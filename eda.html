										<p>The following schema pertains to a sampled subset of the ‘MakeupAddiction’ subreddit, featuring both submissions and comments datasets. Given the considerable size of the original data and computational constraints, each dataset has been sampled down to approximately 10,000 rows. For the comments dataset, we have a total of 9,959 entries, encompassing contributions from 6,993 distinct authors. The submissions dataset comprises 9,734 entries, with 5,573 unique authors having made submissions.</p>

                    <p>In our analysis of the sampled datasets from the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit, we first undertake a thorough assessment of missing values. Given the extensive number of columns in the submissions dataset, we streamline our focus by pre-selecting columns pertinent to our forthcoming analysis. This targeted approach allows us to evaluate missing data with greater efficiency and specificity.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, we analyze the textual content within the ‘body’ field of both submissions and comments datasets, examining the length of entries as a measure of engagement and detail. This step includes computing word counts to gain insights into the depth of discussions and user contributions.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous examination for potential data corruption. This involves identifying and scrutinizing any rows with anomalies that could signify data integrity issues, such as irregular patterns or incomplete records. By addressing these critical areas, we ensure the robustness and reliability of our dataset before proceeding with deeper analytical endeavors.</p>
                    <p>Upon inspecting the comments dataset for missing values, we discovered that the columns <code>author_cakeday</code>, <code>author_flair_css_class</code>, and <code>author_flair_text</code> exhibit a missing value rate exceeding 99%. This high percentage of absence indicates that these columns hold minimal informational value. Consequently, to streamline our dataset and enhance analytical efficiency, we have decided to omit these columns from the comments dataset.</p>
                    <p>While inspecting the submissions dataset for missing values, we discorvered that the columns <code>thumbnail_height</code>,<code>thumbnail_width</code>,<code>Media</code>,<code>post_hint</code>,<code>promoted</code>,<code>promoted_by</code>,<code>promoted_display_name</code>,</p>
                    <p><code>promoted_url</code>,<code>original_link</code>,<code>link_flair_text</code>,<code>embed_type</code>,<code>domain_override</code>,<code>author_flair_text</code>,</p>
                    <p><code>brand_safe</code>,<code>crosspost_parent</code>,<code>crosspost_parent_list</code>,<code>disable_comments</code>,<code>distinguished</code> and <code>domain</code> exhibit a missing value rate exceeding 99%. This high percentage of absence indicates that these columns hold minimal informational value. Consequently, to streamline our dataset and enhance analytical efficiency, we have decided to omit these columns from the submissions dataset.</p>

                    <p>The most striking feature of this graph is the left-skewed distribution, indicating that the majority of comments are of shorter length. Specifically, a large number of comments have a text length of under 500 characters, as shown by the first bar towering over the rest. As the text length increases, the frequency of such comments sharply decreases, which is evidenced by the rapid drop in bar heights moving rightward on the x-axis.</p>
                    <p>We observe very few comments with a text length greater than 1000 characters. This trend continues to taper off as the text length increases further, with minimal occurrences of comments exceeding 1500 characters in length. Overall, the distribution suggests that within this particular set of data, users tend to leave shorter comments rather than longer ones.</p>
                    <iframe src="eda/text_len_submissions.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
                    <p>The distribution is highly left-skewed, signifying that a vast majority of the submissions consist of shorter texts. The first bar, representing submissions with text lengths of up to around 250 characters, is the most prominent feature of the graph, indicating that most submissions contain relatively short text.                    </p>
                    <p>The frequency of submissions decreases precipitously as text length increases, with very few submissions featuring text lengths over 1,000 characters. Submissions with text lengths beyond this point are exceedingly rare, suggesting that longer form submissions are not common within this dataset.</p>
                    <p>This pattern suggests that users of this platform or community tend to favor brevity in their submissions. To understand the reasons behind this trend, one might need to look into the platform’s character limits, user behavior, or the nature of the content being submitted.</p>

                      <p>
                          The “Summary Statistics of Subreddit Submissions” table presents a comprehensive overview of various metrics related to subreddit posts, analyzed over 9734 submissions. Key insights include a moderate average number of comments per post (about 10.39), but with a high variance indicating significant differences in engagement levels across posts. Crossposting appears to be a rare activity, as reflected by an average of just 0.011 crossposts per submission. The scores of posts show a wide range, from 0 to a striking 22,251, pointing to substantial variability in how posts are received by the community. Thumbnail dimensions, analyzed for a subset of 6075 submissions, average around 123 by 133 pixels, with less variation compared to other metrics. Lastly, the gilding feature is scarcely used, with an average of 0.0035 gilds per post, underscoring its rarity.

                      <h3><b>List Top 10 Creators in MakeupAddiction Subreddit</b></h3>
                      <iframe src="eda/top_10_creators_dataframe.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>First observation is that, since we cover 12-month data in 2021 and 2022, while only covers from Jan to March in 2023. It’s easily to find that the number of submission and creator score(with special emphasis to the sub_count) of 2023 is generally less than 2021 and 2022.
                        Examining the external data, Reddit Karma stands as a reflection of a Redditor’s impact on the community. An interesting observation arises from the case of Redditor ‘strawbrryshrtcke’ with a Karma score of 0, suggesting possible account inactivity. In contrast, our analysis of the top 10 creators from 2021 to 2023 reveals consistently high Karma scores. Remarkably, the top 5 creators consistently exhibit substantially higher Karma, indicating that their contributions are exceptionally well-received by fellow Redditors. This correlation affirms the accuracy of our ranking methodology.
                        It’s also worth mentioning that Redditor”ahbagelxo” is a consistent performer with high average scores and comments, who is active in both 2022 and 2023. Redditor “ahbagelxo” is active across all years with varying performance metrics.</p>

                  <h3><b>The peak hours and seasonality trends and potential festival or holiday impacts for makeup-related content</b></h3>
                  <iframe src="eda/fig_hourly.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
                  <p>There’s a clear cyclical pattern to the posting volume throughout the day.Post volume starts to increase from the early hours of the morning, peaking at around the 4th hour (4 AM). A significant dip occurs after this peak, where the volume gradually decreases and reaches the lowest point around the 9th hour (9 AM). There is a gradual increase in posting activity from the late morning to early afternoon, suggesting increased user activity during these hours. Another peak in post volume is observed in the evening, starting to rise around the 15th hour (3 PM) and peaking around the 21st hour (9 PM). The post volume decreases after the late evening peak, indicating that activity slows down as it gets later in the night.</p>
                  <p>The average score, which can be a proxy for how engaged users are with the content or how well-received the posts are, does not follow the same pattern as the post volume. Despite lower post volumes in the early morning (around 4 AM), the average score for posts is relatively high. This might suggest that the users who are active during these hours are more engaged or the content is well-curated. There’s a noticeable dip in average score starting from the morning and reaching the lowest point around the 12th hour (noon). From the afternoon onwards, the average score gradually increases, suggesting that user engagement or the reception of the posts improves as the day progresses. The average score seems to peak in the later hours, around the same time as the second volume peak (evening), indicating that the evening content is both abundant and well-received.</p>
                  <p>There doesn’t appear to be a strong direct correlation between post volume and average score. High post volumes sometimes correspond to lower average scores and vice versa. This lack of correlation might imply that when the platform is most crowded (high post volume), individual posts receive, on average, less attention or fewer upvotes. Conversely, during off-peak hours when there are fewer posts, individual posts might stand out more and, therefore, garner higher engagement or upvotes, reflected in a higher average score.</p>
                  <p>Based on above analysis, we can conclude that Users might consider posting in the early morning or later in the evening to potentially achieve higher engagement, as indicated by the average score trends. Marketing strategies or important announcements could be scheduled for times when both post volume and engagement are high, like in the evening hours, to maximize visibility and interaction. Content creators looking for less competition but still decent engagement might target their posts for the early morning hours when the average score is higher even though the volume is lower.                  </p>

                  <p></p>
                  <iframe src="eda/fig_daily.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
                  <p>The blue line represents the number of posts made each day on the subreddit.There is a significant variability in the daily post count, with some days experiencing much higher activity than others. There appears to be occasional spikes in post count, indicating days of particularly high engagement or events that prompt increased posting. For example, we can see an increase in posts around Halloween, where people share their makeup looks, also during the December holidays, the number of post is much higher than days before holidays.</p>
                  <p>The orange line represents the average score of the posts for each day. Unlike post count, the average score seems to have less variability. It generally stays within a narrower range. There is a noticeable spike in average score around January 2023, where the score dramatically increases despite the post count not showing a corresponding spike. This could indicate that while fewer posts may have been made on that day, the posts received a lot of positive engagement (upvotes)                  </p>
                  <p>There does not seem to be a clear long-term trend in post count or average score; both metrics fluctuate without a distinct direction over the two-year period. No strong seasonality is evident in the data, although careful statistical analysis might reveal subtle seasonal patterns.</p>
                  <p>In comparison, while the hourly plot suggested a possible inverse relationship between post volume and average score (higher volume, lower score), the daily plot does not clearly support this on a day-to-day basis, as we see the average score does not always go down on days with higher post counts.</p>

                  <h3><b>Find the top 10 tags in MakeupAddiction Subreddits</b></h3>
                  <iframe src="eda/top_10_tags.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
                  <p>The provided bar charts visually represent the count of the top tags used in the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, offering a clear comparison of their frequency of use.</p>
                  <p>All Years: This interactive plot displays all the tags across the years on a single graph. It has a drop-down menu to select between the years, which would update the graph accordingly. Each bar represents a tag, and the length of the bar shows the count of that tag in a particular year. Different colors distinguish the years—blue for 2021, orange for 2022, and green for 2023.</p>
                  <li>Top Tags in 2021: The bar chart specific to 2021 indicates that ‘face of the day’ was the most popular tag, with the highest count, followed by ‘question’ and ‘discussion’. Other tags like ‘rule removal’, ‘review’, and ‘tutorial’ had significantly lower counts.</li>
                  <li>Top Tags in 2022: In this chart, the ‘question’ tag shows a remarkable increase compared to the previous year, becoming the most used tag. The ‘face of the day’ tag remains high but sees a slight decrease in usage. Similar to 2021, the ‘discussion’ tag is the third most frequent. The other tags continue to show a relatively lower presence.</li>
                  <li>Top Tags in 2023: For the year 2023, the ‘question’ tag continues to dominate, though the total count appears reduced. The ‘face of the day’ tag is still popular but with fewer mentions than in previous years. This chart also reflects a decline in the use of ‘discussion’, ‘review’, and other tags.</li>
                  <p>Across all charts, we can see that the ‘question’ tag tends to be consistently high, which indicates a community focused on inquiries and information seeking. ‘Face of the day’ seems to be a persistently popular subject, though its frequency has diminished slightly over the years. The other tags show less fluctuation but are significant enough to feature in the top 10, suggesting that these topics have a steady but lesser degree of focus within the community. It’s important to note that for 2023, the data might only be partial, and trends could change as the year progresses.                  </p>

                  <h3><b>The impact of visual elements in posts (e.g., images) on user engagement and popularity</b></h3>
                  <p><code>T-test statistics: -9.019779338713029, P-value: 4.61502263055232e-18</code></p>
                  <h4>Statistical Testing:</h4>
                  <p>The t-test results which is provided indicate a very small p-value (4.61502263055232e-18), which is much less than the common significance levels (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01). This implies that the difference in engagement scores between posts with media and those without is statistically significant, and the likelihood that this difference is due to random chance is extremely low.                  </p>
                  <p>The negative t-statistic value (-9.019779338713029) suggests that the mean score of the group with media is lower than the mean score of the group without media, assuming that the order of subtraction in the t-test was (mean of scores without media) - (mean of scores with media).</p>
                  <p>Given this result, we can confidently assert that the presence of media in posts has a significant impact on engagement scores. However, without knowing the context, we can’t determine whether the impact is positive or negative — only that there is a significant difference.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <iframe src="eda/visual_elements.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
                  <p></p>
                  <li>With Media: Most of the engagement scores seem to cluster around the lower end, near 0. This suggests that a majority of posts with media have low engagement scores. There is minimal spread, meaning there isn’t much variability in the scores.</li>
                  <li>Without Media:The scores here show more variability than the “With Media” category. A majority of the posts without media also have low engagement scores, similar to the “With Media” category. However, there are a few scores that are significantly higher, even reaching the 20k mark. These outliers suggest that while most posts without media have low engagement, there are some that have exceptionally high engagement.</li>
                  <li>Comparison: At first glance, it might seem that posts “Without Media” have a potential to achieve much higher engagement scores compared to those “With Media” because of the outliers.However, it’s important to note that the majority of posts in both categories have low engagement, so the outliers should be investigated further to understand the reasons behind their high engagement.                  </li>
                  <p>In conclusion, while most posts, whether with or without media, tend to have low engagement scores, there are a few posts without media that stand out with exceptionally high scores. It would be beneficial to delve deeper into the nature or content of those specific high-scoring posts without media to gain insights into what factors might be driving their high engagement.</p>

                <li><b>is_long_text:</b>we categorized ‘long text’ as comments with a ‘body’ length exceeding 100 and submissions with a ‘selftext’ length exceeding 200.

                <p>In the NLP analysis of beauty brands on the MakeupAddiction forum, dummy variables play a crucial role in categorizing data into “Skincare,” “Makeup,”. These variables enable focused analysis within each category by filtering posts and comments accordingly. Brand names are extracted using NLP techniques from the content, and their occurrences are counted within each category. Simultaneously, sentiment analysis is conducted on comments to determine consumer sentiment towards these brands, categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The integration of these elements - category-specific data segregation using dummy variables, brand mention analysis, and sentiment evaluation - provides a comprehensive understanding of the top discussed brands in each category and the nature of consumer sentiment, guiding strategic business insights for marketing and product development.</p>

                <p>“Karma is a reflection of how much a Redditor’s contributions mean to the community. Making posts that communities find valuable is the way to gain Karma.” –Reddit.com                </p>
                <p>Creators with higher Reddit Karma scores often have a history of posting high-quality content, engaging in meaningful discussions, and contributing positively to the community. Their high Karma scores suggest that their posts and comments are well-received by other Redditors. They are more likely to have a deep understanding of the community’s preferences and interests.</p>
                <p>By integrating Karma as an external data source, we can enrich our analysis and identify not only the top creators based on their post frequency and popularity but also those who have earned credibility, recognition, and respect within the community. Redditor’s Karma in provided by Reddit API and can be rerieved using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library.</p>
