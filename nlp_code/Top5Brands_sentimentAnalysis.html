<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-science-topic">Data Science Topic</h2>
<p>Can we perform product matching and search for information regarding makeup products within the content of posts? Specifically, for the MakeupAddiction forum, can we identify the top 5 most discussed brands under the categories of “Skincare” ,“Makeup” and “bodycare”? Furthermore, can we analyze the comments associated with each post to determine whether these comments express positive or negative sentiments about these brand products?</p>
<ul>
<li><h2 id="business-goal" class="anchored">Business Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>The objective is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the top 5 most discussed brands within the “Skincare,” “Makeup,” categories on the MakeupAddiction forum. Furthermore, we aim to conduct sentiment analysis on comments associated with each post to gauge whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative towards these brand products. The goal is to provide actionable insights for the beauty industry, helping brands understand consumer sentiments and popular products in these categories, ultimately improving their marketing strategies and product development to meet customer demands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="technical-proposal" class="anchored">Technical Proposal</h2>
1.Data Collection:
<ul>
<li>Gather data from the MakeupAddiction subreddit for the years 2021-2023.Extract the necessary columns, including ‘subreddit,’ ‘selftext,’ ‘title,’ and ’num comments’etc for each post from submission dataset.</li>
<li>Collect connected comments of each submissions</li>
</ul>
2.Data Preprocessing:
<ul>
<li>Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and eliminating irrelevant information.</li>
<li>Group comments by post ID to connect posts and their respective comments.</li>
</ul>
3.Dummy Variables:
<ul>
<li>Create three dummy variables for the categories: “Skincare,” “Makeup,” and “Bodycare.”</li>
<li>Assign a ‘1’ to the appropriate category for each post and ‘0’ for the others.</li>
</ul>
4.Brand Identification:
<ul>
<li>Utilize NLP techniques to extract brand names from post content, titles, and comments.</li>
<li>Count the occurrences of brand names within each category.</li>
</ul>
5.Sentiment Analysis:
<ul>
<li>Implement sentiment analysis using NLP libraries (e.g., VADER or TextBlob) to determine whether comments express positive or negative sentiments.</li>
<li>Assign a sentiment score to each comment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Data Integration:
<ul>
<li>Merge the data from the three categories into a single dataset, considering posts with dummy variables.</li>
<li>Combine sentiment analysis results with the posts and comments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analysis:
<ul>
<li>Identify the top 5 most discussed brands in each category by counting their mentions.</li>
<li>Examine the sentiment scores to gauge whether comments express positive or negative sentiments toward these brands.</li>
</ul></li>

afford creams exfoliators oils and ive tested them all out for a good amount of time not just a few days or weeks im really just asking yall if you have any products to recommend me because maybe you

heads white heads and texture on my neck and jawline also close to my ears i have blackheads and two cysts on the back of my neck that i obviously cannot get myself but i dont even know why i have

makeup ever because my mom doesnt either so ive never had it as part of my life but also this means that she cant help me for prom next week and i dont have anyone else to ask for help unless i book an appointment at a store i searched for a ton of threads on beginner makeup but the replies all encompass so many types of brands and offer so many suggestions and wow theres so many choices out

commonly used drugstore product and its often recommended im asian with double eyelids but still a little downturned no acne oily forehead let me know if other details are needed lowbudget cheap as possible since ill only use this for a few formal events a year thank you so so much","ive been thinking of trying some makeup techniques where the lashes are drawn below the actual lash line to enlarge the eyes for various cosplay im planning  however i have naturally dark eyelashes no im not wearing mascara yes they are real  any suggestions for products that would work to whiten my eyelashes enough that i could attempt the trick","so today i visited sephra for the first time in a long while ive had really bad experiences so i tend to browse online only but i really wanted a shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only plucked two hairs today near the tail and now theres a bald patch i didnt realize those two hairs were so important to my brow shape \n\nhow long do i have to suffer with these now terrible looking brows im hoping ill be able to fix it with makeup but im not sure\n\nsorry this isnt necessarily a makeup question i wasnt sure where else to post","ive always struggled finding a makeup remover that wont leave my eyes itchy and puffy right now im using the garnier waterproof micellar water any makeup wipes are a no go i need something that can take off waterproof makeup as well as falscara but also isnt harsh please leave any recommendations","id say i have some experience with makeup but no matter what i do i cant get my contour to look right whether i use a cream or powder product the colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently realized im not a big fan of mascara my lashes are long and straight facing downwards almost i dont want to create a lot of volume or make them very dark so preferably no tubing mascara\n\nwhat id like is something that can help a lot with curling andor lift i want to avoid clumps or making lashes look thicker any recommendations","im looking for something frosty and pearly in sheer pale pinkish opal shade something like

after laser\n\nnot sure if its the correct thread to post this but ive gone for maybe 6 sessions of laser now in the last 3 i keep having ingrown hairs \n\ni dont usually get them even when i shave and its so annoying cause when i tell it to my laser therapist she just say youre not supposed to get it after laser but i only got it cause of lassr\n\n\nanyone else experienced this","i used to do the full glam face with fake eyelashes and the full 9 yards but as i get older early 30s now i just dont care as much im now only doing mascara and brow gel sometimes filling in my brows and sometimes

available even on the official urban decay website they disappeared i wanted to purchase the shade tilt because i loved the matte revolution lipstick version and since it got discontinued there was the liquid lipstick version but thats nowhere to be found in general there are less products available by urban decay at least in germany wondering if its just now or if there is more to it","i want

everyone i recently got started in makeup and at the moment im trying to figure each part of makeup out one by one ive already mastered mascara and i can sort of do lipstick so ive moved on to eyeliner i got a liquid eyeliner because i had tried a pencil eyeliner in the past and i didnt like it but ive found that its really difficult to apply liquid eyeliner with my hooded eyes without smearing it all over my eye and looking like a raccoon i watched some tutorials but they ended up not being very useful i eventually found a good hooded eye makeup guide but the woman in the video said you shouldnt use eyeliner on hooded eyes at all is there something im missing do i just need to practice should i listen to that video and just forget about eyeliner\n\nthanks","i have long

start happening","i hated the hack that you can put some powder in your lashes when applying mascara to make them thicker i have longer than average lashes so i just figured mascara does the job i also hated the idea of powered in eyes because it might get into my eye however i do have trouble with lashes not showing up in pictures so i do wear them some times \n\ni just tried it today and it looked like i had false lashes on i was able to fluff them up and bend them up wards to get the maximum affect i think i might try black eye shadow too but at least how i know how to use some of the powders that dont match me and are wasting away \n\nwish i tried this before what tips or hacks did you avoid or thing were useless but ended up loving","i have very long full eyelashes but theyre brown not black regular mascara just clumps like crazy and using a lash comb after applying damn near takes all the mascara off anyway \n\ni was wondering if anyone knows of a very thin mascara that will add color but not volume im literally using liquid eyeliner as mascara right now because i cant stand the real thing but it doesnt last even an hour there arent any tinting studios i would trust here either so sadly thats of the table","people who do wash their brushes and sponges after every use why do you do it too\n\ni do it because i hate the thought of wiping used bacteria covered tools

anywhere anymore \n\ni keep having this phenomenon where i see a slightly muted pink and go hey this might be the nude dusty pink im looking for only to get it and wear it and find out its straight up just pink or berry ive wasted so much money doing this before finally realizing i might literally just be looking for varying types of greiges and greiges only to be fair i have a pale low contrast very muted complexion so what could be someone elses dusty pink can often pull way more saturated on me which is probably why id like greiges a lot more for context kvd sanctuary studded kiss is my favorite lipstick but i keep trying to find lighter versions of it for a more nude look and failing  i hate brown greiges though i have a feeling those might still be floating around lc cashmere also seems to be holding on still \n\nhell i even look up swatch videos of greiges on youtube and the earliest video was from 3 years ago most being 58 and like half the lipsticks they swatch are all discontinued now kvd sanctuary has also been discontinued  is greige dying am i doomed to look like a berryeating clown for the rest of my life woe is me this is where i dramatically collapse on the

browndark pink lip some liiiight blush as i find blush doesnt look very good on me a cool toned dewy highlighter and a nude eyeshadow ive been looking around for one pallet with a small handful of nude shades in a small range of colors but without glitter or shimmer im just not a fan and prefer to dab on some highlighter if i want shine since not owning many products is a big deal to me i dont want to buy a pallet with shades i wont use and ive considered buying singles but im worried i would just lose them any recommendations for any makeup product really are welcome but the big question is are there any nude makeup pallets without shimmer excluding nakedbasics","does anyone have recommendations for carmine free lipsticks im allergic and am having trouble finding anything i can use preferably fragrancefree as well as im very sensitive to fragrance but at this point ill take any suggestion that doesnt have freaking carmine in it","i dont wanna look madeup so no foundation no powders no bb creams and so onjust wanna try something which can fill in my acne scarring when i research make upconcealer acne scars most answers are for those with red scars aka hyperpigmentation not actual indented scarring which is my problem its not severe but not as shallow as large pores either\n\nsome users recommend silicone primers as they smoothen skin and correct imperfections i bought a small nyx pore filler tube and applied over my cheeks and yes it gives you that silky touch that absorbs sebum matte effect most primers have and yes my pore size diminished but i didnt see any improvement on my scars if any i couldnt tell\n\nthe problem is acne scars are too deep for cosmetics to settle into the pit is there any thick silicone primer or any other cosmetics that can fill in acne scarring dermaflage has good and bad reviews but its difficult to hack itand more focused on deep isolated scars mine are more shallow and i have lots of them","hey so just as the heading says im 36 and only recently over the last year ive noticed that anytime i wear mascara or put false eyelashes on my eyes hurt for days after they feel irritated nippy and strained ive put drops in as was diagnosed with having dry eyes at the opticians on my last recent visit but i have no idea why the wearing of eye makeup after all this time is triggering it eyeshadow is fine just when i put anything like eyeliner mascara or lashes on","hello everyone ive been thinking and was curious if anyone feels the same i tried nars tinted moisturizer and like all the other tinted moisturizer ive tried it covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","im coming to the end of this driftwood lipfinity lipstick by mac and was very sad to find it had been discontinued i started a hunt for a lilac beige  beige mauve dupe and am stumped does anyone know of a lippie that could mimic this very specific shade its my favourite lippie ever","am i doing something wrong here i dont put mascara on everyday but when i do i curl them and i would find a lash stuck to my curler or floating on the top of my curled lashes is this normal i know its normal to lose lashes daily but it only seems to happen when i curl them","why do most makeup artists advise against doing deep  facials before wedding day makeup or heavy makeup on event days\nthen they proceed to blame their client on having a  facial 23 days or even a week  before the event

around 27 it was around then that i stopped wearing makeup because i felt it made my eyes look worse its my eyes that i have serious issues with i feel like my eye lids are very heavy but i am now wondering if its my eyebrows that have sunken down note i do see a therapist weekly and i see a psychiatrist for medication\n\ni also deal with depression and anxiety  its definitely like a chain link where one causes the other  depression and anxiety doesnt help with crying my eyes out a lot getting stressed out  affects sleep and aging sucks i feel like in my 20s i was awful not only with rubbing my eyes a lot and not being gentle at all with taking off eye makeup but i was notorious for going to sleep with my makeup on i know very very bad \n\nso two reasons i dont wear makeup now one i feel like  especially eye shadow really makes my eyelids more prominent in a bad way any bit of droppiness or sagging i feel like shows way more with eye liner on top lids or eyeshadow so mascara would be just fine especially since i have long eyelashes and have gotten compliments several times before on the length of them but taking off eye makeup really worries me with making the skin around my eyes worse i know underneath your eyes which isnt the best either but i am more worried about the eyelids  i know thats a very thin and delicate area so i worry taking off the makeup even if im gentle will just exacerbate those issues also i have tried a few different types of makeup remover and i feel like it takes multiple tries for the eye makeup to fully come off and no its not waterproof mascara that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago when i saw it i think i got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of products or wondered if i would even be able to accomplish that look since ive never been that great with makeup application\n\nanyway

suited for my right eye shape\n\ni thought it might be the way im holding it but im not so sure usually i hold the curler with my right hand when i do my right eye and my left hand when i do my left eye today i tried holding it with my right hand for both and got the same results\n\nanother factor is the fact that my lashes on my left eye seem to grow in different directions sometimes i notice it

time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","okay hear me out\ni love think

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking

really think it did much i did cureology but it didnt really give me the results i wanted my skin is really dry after being thoroughly dissatisfied with the way my skin looked with foundation i began doing research into skincare i now have a pretty long skin care routine but the main important productsactive ingredients are cleanser hyaluronic acid vitamin c benzoyl peroxide eye cream and moisturizer collagen and spf after applying these day and night i have noticed a massive change in my makeup today i went to the mall for the first time since incorporating the skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to

just palettes \n\nthanks in advance","howdy everyone i am new to make up wore it 5 years ago but have not in a long time but have returned to wearing it regularly and am in a predicament i would say i

29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used to","the consistency of this blush is probably my all time favorite but buying more shades is a little out of my price range does anybody have any good dupe recommendations for the same type of

recommendations on makeup that may reduce or not be the cause of breakouts","yesterday i published a purple eyeshadow look and i mentioned that lavender was a very underrated color since where i live i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing makeup for a little over a year just brows mascara and eyeliner but i cant seem to figure out how to stop my eyeliner from smudging in the outer corner\n\ni have slightly hooded eyes that are

slightly straight line and kind of smoke it out a tiny bit also i use a brown powder eyeliner or black pencil liner since theyre less intense in my experience and match the look im going for better\n\nmy eyeliner stays on decently everywhere other than that outer corner of my eye where it makes everything around it smudge downwards so much and it looks terrible i really want to learn how to fix this problem as i love wearing eyeliner so much  ive tried different types of liners like powder gel liquid and pencil but they all rub off if anyone has any advice on how to avoid this any eyeliner recommendations or just how to do my eyeliner better i would appreciate it so much lt3","tubular mascara is different from regular mascara in that it its not just coating your lashes but essentially creating protective tubes over each lash they dont smudge like traditional mascara and last all day they can easily be removed with just water and a cotton round \n\nmy favorite so far has been trish mcevoy high volume mascara in jet black it stays put and keeps my lashes soft it would be nice if it had a slightly better brush that allowed for more volume it definitely gives me a natural look i will say that i do notice a small amount of flaking through the day \n\nare there any other tubular mascaras out there that dont flake","hello im a costume designer working on an

i love discovering hidden bonus features and functions in products im sure many of these features didnt intend to be hidden but are not so apparent when using a product two examples from my makeup

therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a

dries out and fades option two would be a foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never

for my makeup to last or not look weird by the end of my 12 hour shift \n\nright now im fluctuating between \n1 only using concealer over my entire face no primer the makeup on my nose and chin seem to rub off within an hour or so but the overall wearoff process looks more natural\n\n2 using ud primer and all nighter setting spray with foundation and a full face this technique seems to still rub

im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see their products being sold at places like marshalls and dollarama for those who dont know  dollarama is a store in canada that sells things for 4 or less and sometimes resells stuff from walmart target etc\n\nim already a believer of if you bought something before you decided not to support them use up what you already have to get your moneys worth and dont rebuy meaning i have a lot of lipsticks to get through since i found a bullet formula i loved snatched up a bunch of shades at the drug store then found out the ceo was funding a cause i disagree with\n\nquestion 1  does anyone know what the deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

pros and cons\n\n liquid lipstick\n\n stays long on your lips there are some exceptions but most of my liquid lipsticks stay long on my lips\n beautiful matte finish talking about the classic liquid lipstick \n saturated color\n crisp line is easier to achieve\n\n can be drying\n color can be darker when it dried on your lips\n can expire faster but can be avoided if you use a clean lip brush instead of the liquid lipstick applicator \n precise application is a must especially with fast drying liquid lipsticks\n sometimes hard to remove\n can be hard to reapply evenly\n your lips can be emphasized in a bad way for example the fine lines on your lips depending on the formulafinish\n not many finishes available but you can make matte liquid lipsticks glossy by applying a clear lipgloss over it or apply highlighter over it for a shiny finish without losing the long lasting effect\n\nbullet lipstick\n\n often easy to apply\n sometimes you can choose how much your lips are saturated by the color by using a lip brush or your fingers\n many finishes available\n easy to remove\n its possible to make your lipstick stay longer by using the tissue trick if you want a matte finish this also is a must but does not work with glossy lipsticks\n reapplying can be easier\n\n not all bullet lipsticks stay long on your lips depending on the formulafinish and what you eatdrink during wearing the lipstick \n feathering lipstick but can be avoided by using a lip liner first \n depending on what you want the color might not always be well saturated\n lip liner could be needed with some lipsticks feathering for example \n getting a crisp line requires some more work applying lip liner or lip color by using a precise lip brush\n often not kiss proof depending on formulafinish and if you used the tissue trick\n\nfor both\n\n lips must be prepared exfoliated and moisturized \n\neven though liquid lipstick became very popular over the last years i tend to use my bullet lipsticks more i still like to use liquid lipsticks though it depends on the occasion environment and my mood \nif i need my lipstick to last very long im choosing liquid lipstick or the retro matte bullet

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes with it","hi im just on here looking for some color coding advice so i have blue hair and hazel eyes and im trying to do a look that compliments both looks so i was wondering if anyone could suggest

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","i noticed by watching some youtube reviews

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

nice as well but what worries me is that there isnt as much help afterwards in the industry and they dont promise help with placement or networking\n\nin the long run which is better in your guys

you can be in the absence of albinism i am tired of my foundation nars natural radiant longwear ending up on my deeper toned partners face and its happened to multiple so cant be boiled down to an individuals specific skin type i have tried urban decay original all nighter setting spray morphe continuous setting mist and the too faced 3 in 1 im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable \n\nanyways its embarrassing and i dont want to have to think about that when im smoochin someone\n\nif it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one lol\n1 skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w spf that i let soak in a little bit\n2 super light light barely there dusting of too faced translucent setting powder\n3 followed by a whole face application of setting spray not heavy just mist the whole face with morphe continuous setting mist\n4 you wait till that driessoaks in and then you apply primer i was using maybelline master primer w spf but recently started using the ud all nighter ultra glow face primer dewy foundation grip what a long name both are great\n5 then top with concealer if applicable andor foundation \n6 totally forgot to add i do spray the setting spray all over once im done with my makeup\n\nthis has always been an issue before my tiktok routine before product changes etc so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better settingfinishing spray or something but im open to anything im genuinely tired of this happening","hey everyone im new to makeup \n\nive been struggling to find my shade in everything ive tried too many foundations that are always too pale or too

probably land somewhere in neutral territory however how do i know my own personal preferences arent influencing how i determine my undertone  \n\n\nfor example i prefer cooler tones generally speaking also very richjewel colors as well as silver jewelry so since i really dislike yellow gold jewelry on myself how do i know that it doesnt actually look good on me but i just cant tell how am i supposed to answer the question which colors look best on you and does silver or gold look best on you if my own personal preferences lean so heavily one way over the other \n\nampx200b\n\nas i said before im pretty sure im neutraltoned description of my features below so i guess this probably doesnt matter too muchbut it really does matter to me and id like to know id like to have at least a decent idea of what looks best on meeven if that does mean warmer colors and gold jewelry id just like to know for sure also im thinking about getting my hair colored so knowing if i should sway more warm or cool matters to me\n\nampx200b\n\njust for some context here are a description of my features that are mostoften used to determine undertone\n\n green eyes\n darkish brown hair\n i think the veins in my arms look mostly green but i feel like there is definitely some blue in there and the veins in my legs tend to be more bluish but im not sure if that matters\n i burn and then tan\n i have freckles and they come out more in the sun but isnt that true for everyone\n here is where i feel like i dont have a clue i feel like my skin is pinkish but then there have definitely been times where to my dismay ive felt like my skin is yellowy is that just my own insecurity my own personal bias again i have no idea but i definitely do think its pinkish in areas particularly in my hands again if that matters im not sure if i blush easily other people would have to tell me that but my face does get red from like exercise and stuff im sorry this is probably of no help\n\nanyone have any idea any advice thanks in advance","i just bought this for 24 usa and i really like it the packaging is very cute and convenient it came with a mirror but it is very dull and i cant really see in it i bought the lightest set so i dont know how it looks on others but it looks cute on my very fair skin especially the blush shade\n\nblush looks more orange and bright than in the panphotos kinda peachy cute has some glitter but it doesnt show up on the skin really at all nice pigment id say its buildable\n\nhighlight natural and i like the shade more subtle than i was hoping though very nice for

discovered this sub ive been trying to figure out my undertone i dont wear foundation much but the closest match i have is maybelline 220 except it pulls grey on my forehead ive been trying to find my skin undertone for a while now \ni have deep brown hair and medium brown eyes both have considerable amounts of red in fact i pull off dyed muted red hair shockingly well \nhere are some of the things that do not suit me\n1 corals any and all bright corals do not suit me\n2 peach unless it is mixed with brown to the point the peach is negligible they do not suit me like at all this is possibly the worst colour on me \n3 blue based pinks big nope makes me look weird pink has to be almost mauvish dusty mixed with brown or red to suit me \n4 lime yellow does not suit me\n5 pastels are the bane of my existence \n\ncolours that do suit me\n1 red be it burgundy blue based or warm reds with orange undertones it will suit me\n2 brown neutral warm with orangeyellow  or greyish it suits me\n3 greyboth deep and lighter ones suit me\n4 greens in general suit me emeralds parrot green and darker lemon greens are great \n5 blue jewel toned blues suit me but baby blues do not cornflower blue looks best on me along with aquamarine darker blues too\n6 black beige and tan they really look good\n7 darker eyeshadows tend to overwhelm my eyes despite having brown eyes blue eyeshadows dont look good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10 purples lilacs lilacs dont suit me but warmer purplesviolets are great \n\n\ni have pigmented lips bordering on brownpurple which makes any peachy lipstick look really fucked up i tend to stick to red

only but i really wanted a shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only plucked two hairs today near the tail and now theres a bald patch i didnt realize those two hairs were so important to my brow shape \n\nhow long do i have to suffer with these

powder product the colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently

said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so

like  especially eye shadow really makes my eyelids more prominent in a bad way any bit of droppiness or sagging i feel like shows way more with eye liner on top lids or eyeshadow so mascara would be just fine especially since i have long eyelashes and have gotten compliments several times before on the length of them but taking off eye makeup really worries me with making the skin around my eyes

just exacerbate those issues also i have tried a few different types of makeup remover and i feel like it takes multiple tries for the eye makeup to fully come off and no its not waterproof mascara that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago

version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying moisturizer cetaphil facewash for combination skin and occasionally a toner and some vitamin c serum im not

undertones and my skin is combo but leans dry i prefer a demimatte finish so hoping to avoid something that looks super heavy i have really sensitive skin so anything with fragrance is out \n\nim strongly considering nars light reflecting or charlotte tilbury but if there are other options yall love please share them \n\nits only been in the last year or so that ive felt like i need a brow product so im new to them my brows have always been fairly thick but i get some sparse spots with monthly hormonal shifts ive quit dying my hair so i have a few gray streaks now it was a warm medium brown when i was younger but now the brown is darker my brows arent really graying yet and are almost black but black brow product looks too stark and medium brown products are looking too light\n\nshould i try a gray brow option anyway or should i be looking for a dark ashy brown i dont really like a slicked down look on me so im not even sure what to look for in a formula so far ive just tried the loreal micro ink pen too light or eyeliner i think i like the pen but with limited brow product experience there may be better options just need something to fill with a bit i dont need to recreate the whole brow at this point \n\nthanks in advance for any help i know my brows are in desperate need of some maintenance im getting over a cold and just slapped some shadow on today and did not address my inner corners so this is not my usual eye makeup and it looks awfulbut hopefully the pic helps with color suggestions

cystic acne and blackheads i work as a nurse aide so im working long shifts with a mask on any recommendations for building my regimen i was planning on getting either the milk hydro grip or the milk

pot concealer which i like \n\nfor my skincare ive been washing with the cerave foaming wash and using the ordinary niacinamide 10 serum and differin gel i was thinking of getting a dr zenovia skin

thanks","so i used to use the original mac face and body years ago in the shade c6 i wanted to buy it again but i saw they have a new one called studio radiance i want to try it but im wondering if

for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","okay hear me out\ni love think

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","i

many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to

ive tried recently i found that item mascara doesnt hurt my eyes and its waterproof which is usually great \n\nim going to be in a short film as a favor to a friend where i need to cry and have mascara fall down my face im hoping to find a mascara that wont give my eyes an allergic reaction but isnt waterproof in fact the easier it comes off with water the better i know its a weird ask but hoping someone in this thread might be able to help","i am getting lasik next week and im super excited i know i wont be able to wear any eye makeup like mascara or eyeshadow for at least a week preferably even longer im planning on staying away from eyeshadow liner and mascara for at least a few weeks just to be safe however i am wondering about face makeup so how soon after lasik did you start wearing makeup again any tricks how to do a fun look without touching my eyes\n\n\nalso my biggest concern is that i have genetically dark undereye circles that i tend to cover daily when did you start wearing things like correctors and concealers after getting lasik im thinking that because they go under my eye and not on it if i carefully apply a tiny amount of freshly opened concealer and afterwards make sure to remove it very carefully as well i should be good to go even a few days post op of course ill be talking about this with my doctor but im wondering about personal experiences as well","hi so im looking for this products that will help me cover up my acne and peeling skin as im using tretinoin for my skin can someone teach some step to do im still pretty new in

\n\nthank you in advance","i have used benefits yes the real mascara for years and absolutely love it however its pricey at around 25  i love the brush i love that it doesnt flake or smear and its easy for me to take off with mild soap and water\n\nim having to work out a new budget with gas prices going through the roof can you recommend a similar item that is more budget friendly","im a 29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used to","the consistency of this blush is probably my all time favorite but buying more shades is a little out of my price range does anybody have any good dupe recommendations for the same type of

my skin colour without a hitch however whenever i wake up i see that my cheeks and whole facial area has clusters of pimples\nive been looking alot into milk makeup kosas amp glossier \nany recommendations on makeup that may reduce or not be the cause of breakouts","yesterday i published a purple eyeshadow look and i mentioned that lavender was a very underrated color since where i live i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing makeup for a little over a year just brows mascara and eyeliner but i cant seem to figure out how to stop my eyeliner from smudging in the outer corner\n\ni have slightly hooded eyes that are somewhere between almond upturned shape and i usually draw my eyeliner downwards following the line from the top of my eye and wrap it around the upturned part of the bottom of my eye to make a slightly straight line and kind of smoke it out a tiny bit also i use a brown powder eyeliner or black pencil liner since theyre less intense in my experience and match the look im going for better\n\nmy eyeliner stays on decently everywhere other than that outer corner of my eye where it makes everything around it smudge downwards so much and it looks terrible i really want to learn how to fix this problem as i love wearing eyeliner so much  ive tried different types of liners like powder gel liquid and pencil but they all rub off if anyone has any advice on how to avoid this any eyeliner recommendations or just how to do my eyeliner better i would appreciate it so much lt3","tubular mascara is different from regular mascara in that it its not just coating your lashes but essentially creating protective tubes over each lash they dont smudge like traditional mascara and last all day they can easily be removed with just water and a cotton round \n\nmy favorite so far has been trish mcevoy high volume mascara in jet black it stays put and keeps my lashes soft it would be nice if it had a slightly better brush that allowed for more volume it definitely gives me a natural look i will say that i do notice a small amount of flaking through the day \n\nare there any other tubular mascaras out there that dont flake","hello im a costume designer working on an

would be the best place to ask \nmy skin has a tendency to get oily rather quickly due to being chronically dehytrated which causes me to have issues with liquid foundations on top of that my

hard to find the right shade within the limited hypoallergenic range ive recently found one thats the perfect shade but it makes my skin insanely oily even more so than other liquid foundations i

i love discovering hidden bonus features and functions in products im sure many of these features didnt intend to be hidden but are not so apparent when using a product two examples from my makeup

therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a

still quite new to it for reference my skin is combo oily forehead dry nose and cheeks i have tried various foundations and concealers throughout the years now from luxury to drugstore i have never been able to find that one product that i keep using i always find something and stop using it within a few weeks because it isnt giving me that natural look i like personally for me im not sure what looks better option one would be to just use concealer where i need it but i do find it very hard to find a good shade match and by the end of the day i dont find it looks that natural anymore as it dries out and fades option two would be a foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never seem to get the coverage i want from a tinted moisturiser im using a retinol sunscreen and great serums so skincare doesnt seem to be an issue any advice on what would be best for a natural look for a guy would be great","tldr do you have tricks for making makeup last while wearing a tight mask for 12 hours thank you in advance \n\n\nfor context i work as an icu nurse that means i am working 12 hour shifts and am required to wear n95 masks throughout the day\n\ni prefer to wear makeup since it makes me feel more put together since i have mild acne  dark circles however  it seems impossible for my makeup to last or not look weird by the end of my 12 hour shift \n\nright now im fluctuating between \n1 only using concealer over my entire face no primer the makeup on my nose and chin seem to rub off within an hour or so but the overall wearoff process looks more natural\n\n2 using ud primer and all nighter setting spray with foundation and a full face this technique seems to still rub off within a few hours and have a flakypiling appearance where the mask was it is hard to describe but half way through the day it looks like my chin appears very patchy and has an odd texture \n\n do yall have any tricks for making make up last in a world of masks any suggestions would be so helpful thank you","hello i will soon be going to vietnam and i am hoping to find my true foundation after

the time i get to work it seems that wearing my face mask causes warm air to escape from the top where there are gaps and condense onto my lashes getting them wet i would like to avoid using waterproof mascara  any other potential solutions thanks\n\nedit i use lancome cils booster primer and too faced better than sex mascara","theres some brands out there that i choose not to support and im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see their products being sold at places like marshalls and dollarama for those who dont know  dollarama is a store in canada that sells things for 4 or less and sometimes resells stuff from walmart target etc\n\nim already a believer of if you bought something before you decided not to support them use up what you already have to get your moneys worth and dont rebuy meaning i have a lot of lipsticks to get through since i found a bullet formula i loved snatched up a bunch of shades at the drug store then found out the ceo was funding a cause i disagree with\n\nquestion 1  does anyone know what the deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

pros and cons\n\n liquid lipstick\n\n stays long on your lips there are some exceptions but most of my liquid lipsticks stay long on my lips\n beautiful matte finish talking about the classic liquid lipstick \n saturated color\n crisp line is easier to achieve\n\n can be drying\n color can be darker when it dried on your lips\n can expire faster but can be avoided if you use a clean lip brush instead of the liquid lipstick applicator \n precise application is a must especially with fast drying liquid lipsticks\n sometimes hard to remove\n can be hard to reapply evenly\n your lips can be emphasized in a bad way for example the fine lines on your lips depending on the formulafinish\n not many finishes available but you can make matte liquid lipsticks glossy by applying a clear lipgloss over it or apply highlighter over it for a shiny finish without losing the long lasting effect\n\nbullet lipstick\n\n often easy to apply\n sometimes you can choose how much your lips are saturated by the color by using a lip brush or your fingers\n many finishes available\n easy to remove\n its possible to make your lipstick stay longer by using the tissue trick if you want a matte finish this also is a must but does not work with glossy lipsticks\n reapplying can be easier\n\n not all bullet lipsticks stay long on your lips depending on the formulafinish and what you eatdrink during wearing the lipstick \n feathering lipstick but can be avoided by using a lip liner first \n depending on what you want the color might not always be well saturated\n lip liner could be needed with some lipsticks feathering for example \n getting a crisp line requires some more work applying lip liner or lip color by using a precise lip brush\n often not kiss proof depending on formulafinish and if you used the tissue trick\n\nfor both\n\n lips must be prepared exfoliated and moisturized \n\neven though liquid lipstick became very popular over the last years i tend to use my bullet lipsticks more i still like to use liquid lipsticks though it depends on the occasion environment and my mood \nif i need my lipstick to last very long im choosing liquid lipstick or the retro matte bullet lipsticks by mac\n\nlooking forward reading your opinions more pros and cons or something else you want to add","so i have been practically makeup free since covid and im in need of new everything

damaged and at least the colors match i go in the room inspect the goods compare it to the one she has and everything looks good \n\ni explain to her what i had done i told her about you beautiful lot

\n\nnow sometimes i can be a bit impulsive and i paid shipping before reading any online reviews or looking up ingredients so i did that after and i was alarmed after looking the product woke up like this foundation shade 105 up on cosdna because i saw that it contains myristyl lactate a 4 on the comedogenic scale and alcohol presumably due to fragrance 5 on irritation so i emailed customer service and asked to cancel explaining the situation that i wasnt comfortable with ingredients they were extremely nice and canceled and refunded shipping cost and said i could keep the product if it arrives\n\nlo and beholdit came today literally one day shipping which is insane in and of itself and i was like well its herei guess it wouldnt hurt to try it and it was literally a perfect match\n\nso i dont know what to do because now i have the perfect foundation match for free but its got some less than stellar ingredients the thing is im big on skincare so my premakeup prep is a

trying to find where i can get budgetfriendly lipsticks that are in more unique shades \n\na few years back i always popped down to boots there i would basically be limited to nyx and thats just about it since then unfortunately even nyx has scaled back what they stock in store and what they carry in boots and superdrug at least locally  for me and online  which is beyond disappointing they basically sell the same neutralsnudes as everyone else \n\nso now im trying my best to find reccs on where to get lipsticks in bluesgreensblacksbolder purplesetc  and especially greens ive been wanting a deep green lipstick forever problem is im trying to find something decent quality that isnt horribly expensive im thinking lt20  maybe lt25 incl shipping  and i dont know where to look lots of indie brands seem promising but the shipping prices to the uk dont justify it at all  plus im really unfamiliar with a lot of them i did try to order one once stuff went wrong with the shipping though and i never got my order in the end generally speaking im not that big into makeup and i havent been following stuff like that for years so im not sure which are reputable like i said most of

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that

or repotting save for hoping that you can return the product guess you can switch to brushes but i wanted the convenience of the stick back so i decided to tear apart the tube and try to fix the issue so you dont have to turns out that the little plastic product base that travels up the screw in the center of the tube breaks probably a lot but you can superglue it back together if you can get it clean enough here is a tutorial i threw together as a starting point if anyone else is so inclined to try to fix this common fault in the stick products are you irked at the shocking lack of best

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

discovered this sub ive been trying to figure out my undertone i dont wear foundation much but the closest match i have is maybelline 220 except it pulls grey on my forehead ive been trying to find my skin undertone for a while now \ni have deep brown hair and medium brown eyes both have considerable amounts of red in fact i pull off dyed muted red hair shockingly well \nhere are some of the things that do not suit me\n1 corals any and all bright corals do not suit me\n2 peach unless it is mixed with brown to the point the peach is negligible they do not suit me like at all this is possibly the worst colour on me \n3 blue based pinks big nope makes me look weird pink has to be almost mauvish dusty mixed with brown or red to suit me \n4 lime yellow does not suit me\n5 pastels are the bane of my existence \n\ncolours that do suit me\n1 red be it burgundy blue based or warm reds with orange undertones it will suit me\n2 brown neutral warm with orangeyellow  or greyish it suits me\n3 greyboth deep and lighter ones suit me\n4 greens in general suit me emeralds parrot green and darker lemon greens are great \n5 blue jewel toned blues suit me but baby blues do not cornflower blue looks best on me along with aquamarine darker blues too\n6 black beige and tan they really look good\n7 darker eyeshadows tend to overwhelm my eyes despite having brown eyes blue eyeshadows dont look good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10

shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only plucked two hairs today near the tail and now theres a bald patch i didnt realize those two hairs were so important to my brow shape \n\nhow long do i have to suffer with these now terrible looking

colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently realized im not a big fan

everyone i recently got started in makeup and at the moment im trying to figure each part of makeup out one by one ive already mastered mascara and i can sort of do lipstick so ive moved on to eyeliner i got a liquid eyeliner because i had tried a pencil eyeliner in the past and i didnt like it but ive found that its really difficult to apply liquid eyeliner with my hooded eyes without smearing it all over my eye and looking like a raccoon i watched some tutorials but they ended up not being very useful i eventually found a good hooded eye makeup guide but the woman in the video said you shouldnt use eyeliner on hooded eyes at all is there something im missing do i just need to practice should i listen to that video and just forget about eyeliner\n\nthanks","i have long

powders no bb creams and so onjust wanna try something which can fill in my acne scarring when i research make upconcealer acne scars most answers are for those with red scars aka hyperpigmentation not actual indented scarring which is my problem its not severe but not as shallow as large pores either\n\nsome users recommend silicone primers as they smoothen skin and correct imperfections i bought a small nyx pore filler tube and applied over my cheeks and yes it gives you that silky touch that absorbs sebum matte effect most primers have and yes my pore size diminished but i didnt see

covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","im coming to the end of this driftwood lipfinity lipstick by mac and was very sad to find it had been discontinued i started a hunt for a lilac beige  beige mauve dupe and am stumped

around 27 it was around then that i stopped wearing makeup because i felt it made my eyes look worse its my eyes that i have serious issues with i feel like my eye lids are very heavy but i am now wondering if its my eyebrows that have sunken down note i do see a therapist weekly and i see a psychiatrist for medication\n\ni also deal with depression and anxiety  its definitely like a chain link where one causes the other  depression and anxiety doesnt help with crying my eyes out a lot getting stressed out  affects sleep and aging sucks i feel like in my 20s i was awful not only with rubbing my eyes a lot and not being gentle at all with taking off eye makeup but i was notorious for going to sleep with my makeup on i know very very bad \n\nso two reasons i dont wear makeup now one i feel like  especially eye shadow really makes my eyelids more prominent in a bad way any bit of droppiness or sagging i feel like shows way more with eye liner on top lids or eyeshadow so mascara would be just fine especially since i have long eyelashes and have gotten compliments several times before on the length of them but taking off eye makeup really worries me with making the skin around my eyes worse i know underneath your eyes which isnt the best either but i am more worried about the eyelids  i know thats a very thin and delicate area so i worry taking off the makeup even if im gentle will just exacerbate those issues also i have tried a few different types of makeup remover and i feel like it takes multiple tries for the eye makeup to fully come off and no its not waterproof mascara that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago when i saw it i think i got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of products or wondered if i would even be able to accomplish that look since ive never been that great with makeup application\n\nanyway

time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","okay hear me out\ni love think

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","i

doing research into skincare i now have a pretty long skin care routine but the main important productsactive ingredients are cleanser hyaluronic acid vitamin c benzoyl peroxide eye cream and moisturizer collagen and spf after applying these day and night i have noticed a massive change in my makeup today i went to the mall for the first time since incorporating the skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to realize that my makeup didnt look good due to a lack of skincare and if more influencers truly explained why its vital to makeup i think a lot more people would be satisfied with their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with your foundation i beg of you to try and develop a skincare routine all of the products i use are from target and i can go in depth in the comments what do u guys think","ok weird and random and not totally make up related

know this may seem super strange but hear me out lmao\n\nampx200b\n\ni have used mascara everyday for the past 20 years pretty much anytime i would go out anywhere i would put on 23 coats of mascara i typically use volumizing mascaras cg lashblast maybelline the colossal maybelline the falsies loreal voluminous etc you get the point naturally since we were all quarantining i never wore makeup because i wasnt going out lol\n\nwell once quarantine in the states let up and everyone started to go back to somewhat normalcy whenever i get the chance to go somewhere i put on mascara at first i noticed my usual goto in the past prequarantine the falsies wasnt going on how i like it to i also noticed my eyelashes wont hold their shape and almost point downwards which i never noticed before on my bare lashes i never curled my lashes in the past as my eyelashes always had a nice curl to them naturally i thought maybe it was just the mascara so bought another goody i liked the colossal same thing loreal voluminous yup same even after building uplayering the mascara my eyelashes barely look coated in anything\n\nampx200b\n\nsoooomy question here is previously since i wore mascara a lot in

palettes mostly i packed it all up into a carry on suitcase but now i am wondering if i should take it all out of the boxes to avoid being accidentally charged import fees on makeup that i have owned

suggest the best course of action \n\ni have never been stopped during my visits to the nl and none of my suitcases have been singled out and scanned so i am wondering if i really need to get rid of all the boxes or if its ok to keep them to put it into perspective its probably about 15k in makeup all together and i already plan on putting all the liquids into checked luggage so its literally just palettes \n\nthanks in advance","howdy everyone i am new to make up wore it 5 years ago but have not in a long time but have returned to wearing it regularly and am in a predicament i would say i

29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used to","the consistency of this blush is probably my all time favorite but buying more shades is a little out of my price range does anybody have any good dupe recommendations for the same type of

recommendations on makeup that may reduce or not be the cause of breakouts","yesterday i published a purple eyeshadow look and i mentioned that lavender was a very underrated color since where i live i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing makeup for a little over a year just brows mascara and eyeliner but i cant seem to figure out how to stop my eyeliner from smudging in the outer corner\n\ni have slightly hooded eyes that are

slightly straight line and kind of smoke it out a tiny bit also i use a brown powder eyeliner or black pencil liner since theyre less intense in my experience and match the look im going for better\n\nmy eyeliner stays on decently everywhere other than that outer corner of my eye where it makes everything around it smudge downwards so much and it looks terrible i really want to learn how to fix this problem as i love wearing eyeliner so much  ive tried different types of liners like powder gel liquid and pencil but they all rub off if anyone has any advice on how to avoid this any eyeliner recommendations or just how to do my eyeliner better i would appreciate it so much lt3","tubular mascara is different from regular mascara in that it its not just coating your lashes but essentially creating protective tubes over each lash they dont smudge like traditional mascara and last all day they can easily be removed with just water and a cotton round \n\nmy favorite so far has been trish mcevoy high volume mascara in jet black it stays put and keeps my lashes soft it would be nice if it had a slightly better brush that allowed for more volume it definitely gives me a natural look i will say that i do notice a small amount of flaking through the day \n\nare there any other tubular mascaras out there that dont flake","hello im a costume designer working on an

therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a

looks better option one would be to just use concealer where i need it but i do find it very hard to find a good shade match and by the end of the day i dont find it looks that natural anymore as it dries out and fades option two would be a foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never seem to get the coverage i want from a tinted moisturiser im using a retinol sunscreen and great serums so skincare doesnt seem to be an issue any advice on what would be best for a natural look for a

for my makeup to last or not look weird by the end of my 12 hour shift \n\nright now im fluctuating between \n1 only using concealer over my entire face no primer the makeup on my nose and chin seem to rub off within an hour or so but the overall wearoff process looks more natural\n\n2 using ud primer and all nighter setting spray with foundation and a full face this technique seems to still rub

waterproof mascara  any other potential solutions thanks\n\nedit i use lancome cils booster primer and too faced better than sex mascara","theres some brands out there that i choose not to support and im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see their products being sold at places like marshalls and dollarama for those who dont know  dollarama is a store in canada that sells things for 4 or less and sometimes resells stuff from walmart target etc\n\nim already a believer of if you bought something before you decided not to support them use up what you already have to get your moneys worth and dont rebuy meaning i have a lot of lipsticks to get through since i found a bullet formula i loved snatched up a bunch of shades at the drug store then found out the ceo was funding a cause i disagree with\n\nquestion 1  does anyone know what the deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

pros and cons\n\n liquid lipstick\n\n stays long on your lips there are some exceptions but most of my liquid lipsticks stay long on my lips\n beautiful matte finish talking about the classic liquid lipstick \n saturated color\n crisp line is easier to achieve\n\n can be drying\n color can be darker when it dried on your lips\n can expire faster but can be avoided if you use a clean lip brush instead of the liquid lipstick applicator \n precise application is a must especially with fast drying liquid lipsticks\n sometimes hard to remove\n can be hard to reapply evenly\n your lips can be emphasized in a bad way for example the fine lines on your lips depending on the formulafinish\n not many finishes available but you can make matte liquid lipsticks glossy by applying a clear lipgloss over it or apply highlighter over it for a shiny finish without losing the long lasting effect\n\nbullet lipstick\n\n often easy to apply\n sometimes you can choose how much your lips are saturated by the color by using a lip brush or your fingers\n many finishes available\n easy to remove\n its possible to make your lipstick stay longer by using the tissue trick if you want a matte finish this also is a must but does not work with glossy lipsticks\n reapplying can be easier\n\n not all bullet lipsticks stay long on your lips depending on the formulafinish and what you eatdrink during wearing the lipstick \n feathering lipstick but can be avoided by using a lip liner first \n depending on what you want the color might not always be well saturated\n lip liner could be needed with some lipsticks feathering for example \n getting a crisp line requires some more work applying lip liner or lip color by using a precise lip brush\n often not kiss proof depending on formulafinish and if you used the tissue trick\n\nfor both\n\n lips must be prepared exfoliated and moisturized \n\neven though liquid lipstick became very popular over the last years i tend to use my bullet lipsticks more i still like to use liquid lipsticks though it depends on the occasion environment and my mood \nif i need my lipstick to last very long im choosing liquid lipstick or the retro matte bullet

still unsure about what this package even is since i was expecting a for the makeup to arrive by july the earliest and b an email or something telling me it was on its way she goes to wash her hands

super excited she comes back out and sees my smile at this point the idea of giving it to her at another time was out the window \n\ni tell her to give me a minute to let me make sure that nothing is damaged and at least the colors match i go in the room inspect the goods compare it to the one she has and everything looks good \n\ni explain to her what i had done i told her about you beautiful lot and finally i gave her the package she was a bit confused and then really excited i told her about all the great suggestions that everyone gave and she was very happy and eager to go and try the

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes with it","hi im just on here looking for some color coding advice so i have blue hair and hazel eyes and im trying to do a look that compliments both looks so i was wondering if anyone could suggest

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","i noticed by watching some youtube reviews

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

probably land somewhere in neutral territory however how do i know my own personal preferences arent influencing how i determine my undertone  \n\n\nfor example i prefer cooler tones generally speaking also very richjewel colors as well as silver jewelry so since i really dislike yellow gold jewelry on myself how do i know that it doesnt actually look good on me but i just cant tell how am i supposed to answer the question which colors look best on you and does silver or gold look best on you if my own personal preferences lean so heavily one way over the other \n\nampx200b\n\nas i said before im pretty sure im neutraltoned description of my features below so i guess this probably doesnt matter too muchbut it really does matter to me and id like to know id like to have at least a decent idea of what looks best on meeven if that does mean warmer colors and gold jewelry id just like to know for sure also im thinking about getting my hair colored so knowing if i should sway more warm or cool matters to me\n\nampx200b\n\njust for some context here are a description of my features that are mostoften used to determine undertone\n\n green eyes\n darkish brown hair\n i think the veins in my arms look mostly green but i feel like there is definitely some blue in there and the veins in my legs tend to be more bluish but im not sure if that matters\n i burn and then tan\n i have freckles and they come out more in the sun but isnt that true for everyone\n here is where i feel like i dont have a clue i feel like my skin is pinkish but then there have definitely been times where to my dismay ive felt like my skin is yellowy is that just my own insecurity my own personal bias again i have no idea but i definitely do think its pinkish in areas particularly in my hands again if that matters im not sure if i blush easily other people would have to tell me that but my face does get red from like exercise and stuff im sorry this is probably of no help\n\nanyone have any idea any advice thanks in advance","i just bought this for 24 usa and i really like it the packaging is very cute and convenient it came with a mirror but it is very dull and i cant really see in it i bought the lightest set so i dont know how it looks on others but it looks cute on my very fair skin especially the blush shade\n\nblush looks more orange and bright than in the panphotos kinda peachy cute has some glitter but it doesnt show up on the skin really at all nice pigment id say its buildable\n\nhighlight natural and i like the shade more subtle than i was hoping though very nice for beginners and everyday however\n\nbronzer great shade for fair skin again i dont know about other color sets only cream product very blendable\n\nwhat did you guys think of it","hello people just discovered this sub ive been trying to figure out my undertone i dont wear foundation much but the closest match i have is maybelline 220 except it pulls grey on my forehead ive been trying to find my skin undertone for a while now \ni have deep brown hair and medium brown eyes both have considerable amounts of red in fact i pull off dyed muted red hair shockingly well \nhere are some of the things that do not suit me\n1 corals any and all bright corals do not suit me\n2 peach unless it is mixed with brown to the point the peach is negligible they do not suit me like at all this is possibly the worst colour on me \n3 blue based pinks big nope makes me look weird pink has to be almost mauvish dusty mixed with brown or red to suit me \n4 lime yellow does not suit me\n5 pastels are the bane of my existence \n\ncolours that do suit me\n1 red be it burgundy blue based or warm reds with orange undertones it will suit me\n2 brown neutral warm with orangeyellow  or greyish it suits me\n3 greyboth deep and lighter ones suit me\n4 greens in general suit me emeralds parrot green and darker lemon greens are great \n5 blue jewel toned blues suit me but baby blues do not cornflower blue looks best on me along with aquamarine darker blues too\n6 black beige and tan they really look good\n7 darker eyeshadows tend to overwhelm my eyes despite having brown eyes blue eyeshadows dont look good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10 purples lilacs lilacs dont suit me but warmer purplesviolets are great \n\n\ni have pigmented lips bordering on brownpurple which makes any peachy lipstick look really fucked up i tend to stick to red or neutrals for this matter\n\ni fit both gold and silver jewelry quite well here are some of my pictures in various lighting\n\nhttpsimgurcomabhxidxd\n\nhelp me please tia\n\nedit added pictures for

oil from my eyelids seeps into my eyes and it burns so so so bad every morning without fail after 5 hours of washing my face my face is absolutely disgustingly greasy i may not have the healthiest diet in the world but its not bad at all i dont eat junk everyday i eat regular home meals most of the time in the winter time my skin literally looks like its peeling off you might be thinking so it gets dry and the oil disappears nope its disgustingly greasy and still peeling the dryness is especially prominent on my t zone which is mind blowing since thats also the oiliest part of my face \n\ni also have skin texture that just wont go away every since i was in elementary ive had it i dont have a lot of money to buy good stuff but ive still tried to make do with what i have and nothing has worked i just dont get it and it looks so bad when my face is at its all time grease level just grease and texture on my forehead and cheekbones thats where my texture is mostly at ofc the grease is everywhere \n\nmy nose pores get filled literally overnight i last cleaned them a week ago and they were filled after 5 days then i cleaned them last night with just my nails cuz i dont have anything else and woke up this morning and picked it again and there was a significant amount of gunk and i know i cleaned my nose well last night because i was obsessive about it\n\nive tried soaps i can afford creams exfoliators oils and ive tested them all out for a good amount of time not just a few days or weeks im really just asking yall if you have any products to recommend me because maybe you

heads white heads and texture on my neck and jawline also close to my ears i have blackheads and two cysts on the back of my neck that i obviously cannot get myself but i dont even know why i have

makeup ever because my mom doesnt either so ive never had it as part of my life but also this means that she cant help me for prom next week and i dont have anyone else to ask for help unless i book an appointment at a store i searched for a ton of threads on beginner makeup but the replies all encompass so many types of brands and offer so many suggestions and wow theres so many choices out

possible since ill only use this for a few formal events a year thank you so so much","ive been thinking of trying some makeup techniques where the lashes are drawn below the actual lash line to enlarge the eyes for various cosplay im planning  however i have naturally dark eyelashes no im not wearing mascara yes they are real  any suggestions for products that would work to whiten my eyelashes enough that i could attempt the trick","so today i visited sephra for the first time in a long while ive had really bad experiences so i tend to browse online only but i really wanted a shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only plucked two hairs today near the tail and now theres a bald patch i didnt realize those two hairs were so important to my brow shape \n\nhow long do i have to suffer with these now terrible looking brows im hoping ill be able to fix it with makeup but im not sure\n\nsorry this isnt necessarily a makeup question i wasnt sure where else to post","ive always struggled finding a makeup remover that wont leave my eyes itchy and puffy right now im using the garnier waterproof micellar water any makeup wipes are a no go i need something that can take off waterproof makeup as well as falscara but also isnt harsh please leave any recommendations","id say i have some experience with makeup but no matter what i do i cant get my contour to look right whether i use a cream or powder product the colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently realized im not a big fan of mascara my lashes are long and straight facing downwards almost i dont want to create a lot of volume or make them very dark so preferably no tubing mascara\n\nwhat id like is something that can

after laser\n\nnot sure if its the correct thread to post this but ive gone for maybe 6 sessions of laser now in the last 3 i keep having ingrown hairs \n\ni dont usually get them even when i shave

the full glam face with fake eyelashes and the full 9 yards but as i get older early 30s now i just dont care as much im now only doing mascara and brow gel sometimes filling in my brows and sometimes

said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so

feel the same","im coming to the end of this driftwood lipfinity lipstick by mac and was very sad to find it had been discontinued i started a hunt for a lilac beige  beige mauve dupe and am stumped

my eyes a lot and not being gentle at all with taking off eye makeup but i was notorious for going to sleep with my makeup on i know very very bad \n\nso two reasons i dont wear makeup now one i feel like  especially eye shadow really makes my eyelids more prominent in a bad way any bit of droppiness or sagging i feel like shows way more with eye liner on top lids or eyeshadow so mascara would be just fine especially since i have long eyelashes and have gotten compliments several times before on the length of them but taking off eye makeup really worries me with making the skin around my eyes worse i know underneath your eyes which isnt the best either but i am more worried about the eyelids  i know thats a very thin and delicate area so i worry taking off the makeup even if im gentle will just exacerbate those issues also i have tried a few different types of makeup remover and i feel like it takes multiple tries for the eye makeup to fully come off and no its not waterproof mascara that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago

and i dont know what to try advice please","ive never been really experienced with makeup but i saw people try on the fenty skin tint and everyone ive seen try it love it so i got it i use the benefit porefessional primer the regular one usually as a base for highlighter and other stuff since it says it can be used for that too except i have a small sample of the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying moisturizer cetaphil facewash for combination skin and occasionally a toner and some vitamin c serum im not acneprone and my skin is relatively clear with a few cystic pimples every now and then so i figured what i was using for my skincare was fine but now im not sure and dont know what primer to use

time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what

29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used

i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing

slightly straight line and kind of smoke it out a tiny bit also i use a brown powder eyeliner or black pencil liner since theyre less intense in my experience and match the look im going for better\n\nmy eyeliner stays on decently everywhere other than that outer corner of my eye where it makes everything around it smudge downwards so much and it looks terrible i really want to learn how

eyeliner recommendations or just how to do my eyeliner better i would appreciate it so much lt3","tubular mascara is different from regular mascara in that it its not just coating your lashes but essentially creating protective tubes over each lash they dont smudge like traditional mascara and last all day they can easily be removed with just water and a cotton round \n\nmy favorite so far has

i love discovering hidden bonus features and functions in products im sure many of these features didnt intend to be hidden but are not so apparent when using a product two examples from my makeup history\n\n  some of my lipsticks have a little plastic window showing the color at the base of the package in many brands this portion separates and that is actual lipstick in therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a point on the pigment i thought i just had to use a notecard when lining my lips until i accidentally pulled the sharpener out this morning\n\ni love these things please share any other little secret

im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see

deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

damaged and at least the colors match i go in the room inspect the goods compare it to the one she has and everything looks good \n\ni explain to her what i had done i told her about you beautiful lot

though and i never got my order in the end generally speaking im not that big into makeup and i havent been following stuff like that for years so im not sure which are reputable like i said most of

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes with it","hi im just on here looking for some color coding advice so i have blue hair and hazel eyes and im trying to do a look that compliments both looks so i was wondering if anyone could suggest

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","i noticed by watching some youtube reviews

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then the weather started getting hotter i applied a substantial amount under my foundation and concealer etc and was shocked  my makeup applied beautifully and my skin looked so healthy because it had this moisturising effect i got minimal creasing under my eyes and on my eyelid but it was basically no different than usual \n\ni wore my makeup for the whole day and got back to assess the damage and my skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was completely fine\n\nid highly recommend this

you can be in the absence of albinism i am tired of my foundation nars natural radiant longwear ending up on my deeper toned partners face and its happened to multiple so cant be boiled down to an individuals specific skin type i have tried urban decay original all nighter setting spray morphe continuous setting mist and the too faced 3 in 1 im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my

think about that when im smoochin someone\n\nif it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one lol\n1 skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w spf that i let soak in a little bit\n2 super light light barely there dusting of too faced translucent setting powder\n3 followed by a whole face application of setting spray not heavy just mist the whole face with morphe continuous setting mist\n4 you wait till that driessoaks in and then you apply primer i was using maybelline master primer w spf but recently started using the ud all nighter ultra glow face primer dewy foundation grip what a long name both are great\n5 then top with concealer if applicable andor foundation \n6 totally forgot to add i do spray the setting spray all over once im done with my makeup\n\nthis has always been an issue before my tiktok routine before product changes etc so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better settingfinishing spray or something but im open to anything im genuinely tired of this happening","hey everyone im new to makeup \n\nive been struggling to find my shade in everything ive tried too many foundations that are always too pale or too

probably land somewhere in neutral territory however how do i know my own personal preferences arent influencing how i determine my undertone  \n\n\nfor example i prefer cooler tones generally speaking also very richjewel colors as well as silver jewelry so since i really dislike yellow gold jewelry on myself how do i know that it doesnt actually look good on me but i just cant tell how am i supposed to answer the question which colors look best on you and does silver or gold look best on you if my own personal preferences lean so heavily one way over the other \n\nampx200b\n\nas i said before im pretty sure im neutraltoned description of my features below so i guess this probably doesnt matter too muchbut it really does matter to me and id like to know id like to have at least a decent idea of what looks best on meeven if that does mean warmer colors and gold jewelry id just like to know for sure also im thinking about getting my hair colored so knowing if i should sway more warm or cool matters to me\n\nampx200b\n\njust for some context here are a description of my features that are mostoften used to determine undertone\n\n green eyes\n darkish brown hair\n i think the veins in my arms look mostly green but i feel like there is definitely some blue in there and the veins in my legs tend to be more bluish but im not sure if that matters\n i burn and then tan\n i have freckles and they come out more in the sun but isnt that true for everyone\n here is where i feel like i dont have a clue i feel like my skin is pinkish but then there have definitely been times where to my dismay ive felt like my skin is yellowy is that just my own insecurity my own personal bias again i have no idea but i definitely do think its pinkish in areas particularly in my hands again if that matters im not sure if i blush easily other people would have to tell me that but my face does get red from like exercise and stuff im sorry this is probably of no help\n\nanyone have any idea any advice thanks in advance","i just bought this for 24 usa and i really like it the packaging is very cute and convenient it came with a mirror but it is very dull and i cant really see in it i

worst colour on me \n3 blue based pinks big nope makes me look weird pink has to be almost mauvish dusty mixed with brown or red to suit me \n4 lime yellow does not suit me\n5 pastels are the bane of my existence \n\ncolours that do suit me\n1 red be it burgundy blue based or warm reds with orange undertones it will suit me\n2 brown neutral warm with orangeyellow  or greyish it suits me\n3 greyboth deep and lighter ones suit me\n4 greens in general suit me emeralds parrot green and darker lemon greens are great \n5 blue jewel toned blues suit me but baby blues do not cornflower blue looks best on me along with aquamarine darker blues too\n6 black beige and tan they really look good\n7 darker eyeshadows tend to overwhelm my eyes despite having brown eyes blue eyeshadows dont look good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10 purples lilacs lilacs dont suit me but warmer purplesviolets are great \n\n\ni have pigmented lips bordering on brownpurple which makes any peachy lipstick look really fucked up i tend to stick to red

only but i really wanted a shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only plucked two hairs today near the tail and now theres a bald patch i didnt realize those two hairs were so important to my brow shape \n\nhow long do i have to suffer with these

makeup remover that wont leave my eyes itchy and puffy right now im using the garnier waterproof micellar water any makeup wipes are a no go i need something that can take off waterproof makeup as well as falscara but also isnt harsh please leave any recommendations","id say i have some experience with makeup but no matter what i do i cant get my contour to look right whether i use a cream or powder product the colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently

everyone i recently got started in makeup and at the moment im trying to figure each part of makeup out one by one ive already mastered mascara and i can sort of do lipstick so ive moved on to eyeliner i got a liquid eyeliner because i had tried a pencil eyeliner in the past and i didnt like it but ive found that its really difficult to apply liquid eyeliner with my hooded eyes without smearing it all over my eye and looking like a raccoon i watched some tutorials but they ended up not being very useful i eventually found a good hooded eye makeup guide but the woman in the video said you shouldnt use eyeliner on hooded eyes at all is there something im missing do i just need to practice should i listen to that video and just forget about eyeliner\n\nthanks","i have long

not actual indented scarring which is my problem its not severe but not as shallow as large pores either\n\nsome users recommend silicone primers as they smoothen skin and correct imperfections i

said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so

feel the same","im coming to the end of this driftwood lipfinity lipstick by mac and was very sad to find it had been discontinued i started a hunt for a lilac beige  beige mauve dupe and am stumped

wondering if its my eyebrows that have sunken down note i do see a therapist weekly and i see a psychiatrist for medication\n\ni also deal with depression and anxiety  its definitely like a chain link

like  especially eye shadow really makes my eyelids more prominent in a bad way any bit of droppiness or sagging i feel like shows way more with eye liner on top lids or eyeshadow so mascara would be just fine especially since i have long eyelashes and have gotten compliments several times before on the length of them but taking off eye makeup really worries me with making the skin around my eyes worse i know underneath your eyes which isnt the best either but i am more worried about the eyelids  i know thats a very thin and delicate area so i worry taking off the makeup even if im gentle will just exacerbate those issues also i have tried a few different types of makeup remover and i feel like it takes multiple tries for the eye makeup to fully come off and no its not waterproof mascara that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago

time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic

29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used

i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing makeup for a little over a year just brows mascara and eyeliner but i cant seem to figure out how to stop my eyeliner from smudging in the outer corner\n\ni have slightly hooded eyes that are

slightly straight line and kind of smoke it out a tiny bit also i use a brown powder eyeliner or black pencil liner since theyre less intense in my experience and match the look im going for better\n\nmy eyeliner stays on decently everywhere other than that outer corner of my eye where it makes everything around it smudge downwards so much and it looks terrible i really want to learn how

eyeliner recommendations or just how to do my eyeliner better i would appreciate it so much lt3","tubular mascara is different from regular mascara in that it its not just coating your lashes but essentially creating protective tubes over each lash they dont smudge like traditional mascara and last all day they can easily be removed with just water and a cotton round \n\nmy favorite so far has been trish mcevoy high volume mascara in jet black it stays put and keeps my lashes soft it would be nice if it had a slightly better brush that allowed for more volume it definitely gives me a natural look i will say that i do notice a small amount of flaking through the day \n\nare there any other tubular mascaras out there that dont flake","hello im a costume designer working on an

therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a

dries out and fades option two would be a foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never seem to get the coverage i want from a tinted moisturiser im using a retinol sunscreen and great serums so skincare doesnt seem to be an issue any advice on what would be best for a natural look for a

for my makeup to last or not look weird by the end of my 12 hour shift \n\nright now im fluctuating between \n1 only using concealer over my entire face no primer the makeup on my nose and chin seem to rub off within an hour or so but the overall wearoff process looks more natural\n\n2 using ud primer and all nighter setting spray with foundation and a full face this technique seems to still rub

im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see their products being sold at places like marshalls and dollarama for those who dont know  dollarama is a store in canada that sells things for 4 or less and sometimes resells stuff from walmart target etc\n\nim already a believer of if you bought something before you decided not to support them use up what you already have to get your moneys worth and dont rebuy meaning i have a lot of lipsticks to get through since i found a bullet formula i loved snatched up a bunch of shades at the drug store then found out the ceo was funding a cause i disagree with\n\nquestion 1  does anyone know what the deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

pros and cons\n\n liquid lipstick\n\n stays long on your lips there are some exceptions but most of my liquid lipsticks stay long on my lips\n beautiful matte finish talking about the classic liquid lipstick \n saturated color\n crisp line is easier to achieve\n\n can be drying\n color can be darker when it dried on your lips\n can expire faster but can be avoided if you use a clean lip brush instead of the liquid lipstick applicator \n precise application is a must especially with fast drying liquid lipsticks\n sometimes hard to remove\n can be hard to reapply evenly\n your lips can be emphasized in a bad way for example the fine lines on your lips depending on the formulafinish\n not many finishes available but you can make matte liquid lipsticks glossy by applying a clear lipgloss over it or apply highlighter over it for a shiny finish without losing the long lasting effect\n\nbullet lipstick\n\n often easy to apply\n sometimes you can choose how much your lips are saturated by the color by using a lip brush or your fingers\n many finishes available\n easy to remove\n its possible to make your lipstick stay longer by using the tissue trick if you want a matte finish this also is a must but does not work with glossy lipsticks\n reapplying can be easier\n\n not all bullet lipsticks stay long on your lips depending on the formulafinish and what you eatdrink during wearing the lipstick \n feathering lipstick but can be avoided by using a lip liner first \n depending on what you want the color might not always be well saturated\n lip liner could be needed with some lipsticks feathering for example \n getting a crisp line requires some more work applying lip liner or lip color by using a precise lip brush\n often not kiss proof depending on formulafinish and if you used the tissue trick\n\nfor both\n\n lips must be prepared exfoliated and moisturized \n\neven though liquid lipstick became very popular over the last years i tend to use my bullet lipsticks more i still like to use liquid lipsticks though it depends on the occasion environment and my mood \nif i need my lipstick to last very long im choosing liquid lipstick or the retro matte bullet lipsticks by mac\n\nlooking forward reading your opinions more pros and cons or something else you want to add","so i have been practically makeup free since covid and im in need of new everything

still unsure about what this package even is since i was expecting a for the makeup to arrive by july the earliest and b an email or something telling me it was on its way she goes to wash her hands

super excited she comes back out and sees my smile at this point the idea of giving it to her at another time was out the window \n\ni tell her to give me a minute to let me make sure that nothing is damaged and at least the colors match i go in the room inspect the goods compare it to the one she has and everything looks good \n\ni explain to her what i had done i told her about you beautiful lot

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes with it","hi im just on here looking for some color coding advice so i have blue hair and hazel eyes and im trying to do a look that compliments both looks so i was wondering if anyone could suggest

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","i noticed by watching some youtube reviews

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

new to makeup and ive felt a little stuck before i even start because while there are undoubtedly things about my face i would like to conceal red nose the blue tint of my upper lip mostly i always see the advice to be cover your face in foundation and concealer so you get a blank canvas this is delightful advice for many im sure but i grew up getting teased a lot for my freckles and so theyre a badge of honor for me when i searched this sub most of the stuff i saw about freckles was about fake freckles do yall have any tips on how i can move forward","ive never used foundation before but ive

watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then the weather started getting hotter i applied a substantial amount under my foundation and concealer etc and was shocked  my makeup applied beautifully and my skin looked so healthy because it had this moisturising effect i got minimal creasing under my eyes and on my eyelid but it was basically no different than usual \n\ni wore my makeup for the whole day and got back to assess the damage and my skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was completely fine\n\nid highly recommend this

you can be in the absence of albinism i am tired of my foundation nars natural radiant longwear ending up on my deeper toned partners face and its happened to multiple so cant be boiled down to an individuals specific skin type i have tried urban decay original all nighter setting spray morphe continuous setting mist and the too faced 3 in 1 im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my

probably land somewhere in neutral territory however how do i know my own personal preferences arent influencing how i determine my undertone  \n\n\nfor example i prefer cooler tones generally speaking also very richjewel colors as well as silver jewelry so since i really dislike yellow gold jewelry on myself how do i know that it doesnt actually look good on me but i just cant tell how am i supposed to answer the question which colors look best on you and does silver or gold look best on you if my own personal preferences lean so heavily one way over the other \n\nampx200b\n\nas i said before im pretty sure im neutraltoned description of my features below so i guess this probably doesnt matter too muchbut it really does matter to me and id like to know id like to have at least a decent idea of what looks best on meeven if that does mean warmer colors and gold jewelry id just like to know for sure also im thinking about getting my hair colored so knowing if i should sway more warm or cool matters to me\n\nampx200b\n\njust for some context here are a description of my features that are mostoften used to determine undertone\n\n green eyes\n darkish brown hair\n i think the veins in my arms look mostly green but i feel like there is definitely some blue in there and the veins in my legs tend to be more bluish but im not sure if that matters\n i burn and then tan\n i have freckles and they come out more in the sun but isnt that true for everyone\n here is where i feel like i dont have a clue i feel like my skin is pinkish but then there have definitely been times where to my dismay ive felt like my skin is yellowy is that just my own insecurity my own personal bias again i have no idea but i definitely do think its pinkish in areas particularly in my hands again if that matters im not sure if i blush easily other people would have to tell me that but my face does get red from like exercise and stuff im sorry this is probably of no help\n\nanyone have any idea any advice thanks in advance","i just bought this for 24 usa and i really like it the packaging is very cute and convenient it came with a mirror but it is very dull and i cant really see in it i

good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10 purples lilacs lilacs dont suit me but warmer purplesviolets are great \n\n\ni have pigmented lips bordering on brownpurple which makes any peachy lipstick look really fucked up i tend to stick to red

shade match fyi im a real noob when it comes to base products amp my knowledge is close to 0 i just use eyebrow and eyeliner the first staff i approached and asked for a shade match just took two colours and put it on my hand without saying anything i was a bit clueless on what im suppose to do so i just took the product and rubbed it on my forehead the shades was so off and the staff doesnt look like she was helping me anytime soon i felt helpless  \n\ni tried asking another staff this time she took two shades and brought me to the mirror she asked me qns on what type of product i like and she gave opinions of her own i told her i would like to try a skin tint throughout this whole process she directed me on how to put the product on my face but the thing is when i asked why does the product look patchy she went on about how what we see is filtered fair enough she goes to point her finger towards my acne which i was insecure about and i felt kind of weirded out she would point out flaws and deduce whether this can be covered or not every time i tried to tell her how i felt she shut my opinions down if i was saying that the foundation she asked me to try was too heavy for me she would reply wdym its heavy no its not or foundation is like this it is what it is she also told my friend that i think that she the staff doesnt know what im trying to say she was coming off so strong not sure if thats how this process works but i did feel invalidated her body language and tone made me feel as if i was uneducated about what i like","so my hairs are dark but sparse i only

colour comes out extremely uneven like its balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts and it looks like really exaggerated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or dirt on my face i know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades which make me look even worse since im neutral light olive toned so its not the shade ive used 3ces contour powder in the cooler shade and fenty beautys cream contour stick in amber the shade match for both of these are fine not too dark or light with the perfect amount of cool ashiness to look like a natural shadow its just that i cant get the pigmentation to look even ive tried applying with a brush fingers sponge nothing helps the patchiness gets worse as i blend the product out powdering my skin before contouring has no effect i dont usually use primer since i hate the feeling of too many products on my skin and i dont think this is a dry skin issue as i have moderately oily skin and i regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day my skin isnt perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks but its not that pronounced so i dont think its my skins texture interfering with the product either as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them the driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin and i occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose but my cheeks generally dont have this problem despite that i have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick i do have postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots contouring products seem to emphasise them if that makes sense\n\nplease help i dont know what im doing wrong i cant find anything online that addresses my issue and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin which doesnt seem to be the case for me\n\nif it helps the foundation i use is chanel les beiges healthy glow foundation though sometimes i use diors cushion foundation also i still have a problem with patchy contour even if i skip the foundation and only wear spf over my usual skincare","ive recently realized im not a big fan

that i wear\n\ni saw a youtube tutorial someone made about pretty much giving your eyes an eyelift with just makeup alone she showed a before and after and it looked awesome that was many months ago

something cool or more out there for a concert later this week and i dont know what to try advice please","ive never been really experienced with makeup but i saw people try on the fenty skin tint and everyone ive seen try it love it so i got it i use the benefit porefessional primer the regular one usually as a base for highlighter and other stuff since it says it can be used for that too except i have a small sample of the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying moisturizer cetaphil facewash for combination skin and occasionally a toner and some vitamin c serum im not acneprone and my skin is relatively clear with a few cystic pimples every now and then so i figured what i was using for my skincare was fine but now im not sure and dont know what primer to use google is not helpful either so to my gurus i request assistance","i am ghostwhite natural redhead cool undertone i always need the lightest shade

for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","okay hear me out\ni love think

running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic

really think it did much i did cureology but it didnt really give me the results i wanted my skin is really dry after being thoroughly dissatisfied with the way my skin looked with foundation i began

many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to

29yearold white woman of southern mediterranean descent with dirty blonde hair and darker brows my eyebrows are fairly bushy and my dad basically has a full unibrow if i took no action i would come relatively close to that i tweeze to avoid a unibrow and generally try to clean up super obvious strays elesewhere but not so much as to change the rest of my brow shape\n\nin my teens and early 20s i occasionally got my brows waxed but stopped in my late 20s as bigger brows were more in and i was also lazy \n\nit seems like common brow routines involve some combinations of using a brush to tidy powderpencil to fill in and sometimes a gel or something similar to hold a shape the few times i have attempted something like this once by a professional at ulta after getting my brows waxed and a few times at home using youtube tutorials and a palette i already had i was horrified as i felt filling in my already very large brows with anything that made the brows more darker at all or more pronounced made me look like a cartoon villain i tend to not like big changes the first time i see them though so maybe i did look good and just wasnt used to it i do often wear a full face of makeup eg primer foundation mascara blush occasionally bronzer or countour but usually not eye shadow and eye liner but im very happy socializing or going to work with less makeup or no makeup \n\nwith all this context in mind here is my big question do the vast majority of people look better doing some brow routine as a part of their daily makeup or is it really contingent on their specific brows and the rest of their face i know i like other peoples brow routines but i cant tell if it truly doesnt make sense for me or if i just need to acclimate to seeing myself look different than im used

i hardly see anyone wearing shades like that in the comments some people mentioned that where they are from its more common to see this type of colours so i found it interesting to see what the usual makeup is in each country \n\nfor example i am from spain and most people here wear very basic makeup such as concealer eyeliner naturalcolored lipstick or gloss bronzer blush and mascara people who wear eyeshadow often go for nude colors and wear very simple looks like just putting a light nude shade on the crease and a shimmery shadow on the lid for a more elaborated look most people opt for vibrant pinks reds or dark nude lipsticks or a brown smoky eye\n\ni would also like to know how makeup trends have affected your countries for instance here the trends have not changed much the way people do their make up and although now it is more prevalent that young people like teenagers use colorful eyeshadows and false eyelashes most young adults continue wearing basic makeup and the only thing ive seen is that they have changed is going from a more matte makeup matte base and lipstick to a fresher one base with a dewy finish and more glosses or satin lipsticks","ive only been wearing

i love discovering hidden bonus features and functions in products im sure many of these features didnt intend to be hidden but are not so apparent when using a product two examples from my makeup history\n\n  some of my lipsticks have a little plastic window showing the color at the base of the package in many brands this portion separates and that is actual lipstick in therehttpsipinimgcomoriginalse67985e679857447545371092e82eaab22d8cbjpg its a great feature you get a bit more product when you think youre out its handier to get in there with a brush i could let someone else use that portion if i didnt have a way to sterlize my bullet etc\n\n  those lipliners that come in a plastic twistup tube they usually all have a sharpener in the base to let you get a point on the pigment i thought i just had to use a notecard when lining my lips until i accidentally pulled the sharpener out this morning\n\ni love these things please share any other little secret

the time i get to work it seems that wearing my face mask causes warm air to escape from the top where there are gaps and condense onto my lashes getting them wet i would like to avoid using waterproof mascara  any other potential solutions thanks\n\nedit i use lancome cils booster primer and too faced better than sex mascara","theres some brands out there that i choose not to support and im not going to specifically say which ones so as not the start the discourse i mean you can name names in the comments if you want to im not going to do that right now though but sometimes i see their products being sold at places like marshalls and dollarama for those who dont know  dollarama is a store in canada that sells things for 4 or less and sometimes resells stuff from walmart target etc\n\nim already a believer of if you bought something before you decided not to support them use up what you already have to get your moneys worth and dont rebuy meaning i have a lot of lipsticks to get through since i found a bullet formula i loved snatched up a bunch of shades at the drug store then found out the ceo was funding a cause i disagree with\n\nquestion 1  does anyone know what the deal is with the brands making money when products are sold like this  have they already gotten their share of profits from products being removed from the shelves of say sephora to be sold for a discount at winners making it not matter to them if it gets purchased from that point on  i know in the case of individuals putting palettes and stuff on places like depop the brand obviously isnt making anything from that\n\nquestion 2  do you personally buy products from brands you dont support when theyre on sale or being resold as youre not spending as much of your money andor the brand already got paid for it","hello i am doing my own makeup for my wedding and while that it still a long time away im getting my supplies asap \n\n\nin the mean time i am looking for your favorite blue

pros and cons\n\n liquid lipstick\n\n stays long on your lips there are some exceptions but most of my liquid lipsticks stay long on my lips\n beautiful matte finish talking about the classic liquid lipstick \n saturated color\n crisp line is easier to achieve\n\n can be drying\n color can be darker when it dried on your lips\n can expire faster but can be avoided if you use a clean lip brush instead of the liquid lipstick applicator \n precise application is a must especially with fast drying liquid lipsticks\n sometimes hard to remove\n can be hard to reapply evenly\n your lips can be emphasized in a bad way for example the fine lines on your lips depending on the formulafinish\n not many finishes available but you can make matte liquid lipsticks glossy by applying a clear lipgloss over it or apply highlighter over it for a shiny finish without losing the long lasting effect\n\nbullet lipstick\n\n often easy to apply\n sometimes you can choose how much your lips are saturated by the color by using a lip brush or your fingers\n many finishes available\n easy to remove\n its possible to make your lipstick stay longer by using the tissue trick if you want a matte finish this also is a must but does not work with glossy lipsticks\n reapplying can be easier\n\n not all bullet lipsticks stay long on your lips depending on the formulafinish and what you eatdrink during wearing the lipstick \n feathering lipstick but can be avoided by using a lip liner first \n depending on what you want the color might not always be well saturated\n lip liner could be needed with some lipsticks feathering for example \n getting a crisp line requires some more work applying lip liner or lip color by using a precise lip brush\n often not kiss proof depending on formulafinish and if you used the tissue trick\n\nfor both\n\n lips must be prepared exfoliated and moisturized \n\neven though liquid lipstick became very popular over the last years i tend to use my bullet lipsticks more i still like to use liquid lipsticks though it depends on the occasion environment and my mood \nif i need my lipstick to last very long im choosing liquid lipstick or the retro matte bullet lipsticks by mac\n\nlooking forward reading your opinions more pros and cons or something else you want to add","so i have been practically makeup free since covid and im in need of new everything

damaged and at least the colors match i go in the room inspect the goods compare it to the one she has and everything looks good \n\ni explain to her what i had done i told her about you beautiful lot

trying to find where i can get budgetfriendly lipsticks that are in more unique shades \n\na few years back i always popped down to boots there i would basically be limited to nyx and thats just about it since then unfortunately even nyx has scaled back what they stock in store and what they carry in boots and superdrug at least locally  for me and online  which is beyond disappointing they basically sell the same neutralsnudes as everyone else \n\nso now im trying my best to find reccs on where to get lipsticks in bluesgreensblacksbolder purplesetc  and especially greens ive been wanting a deep green lipstick forever problem is im trying to find something decent quality that isnt horribly expensive im thinking lt20  maybe lt25 incl shipping  and i dont know where to look lots of indie brands seem promising but the shipping prices to the uk dont justify it at all  plus im really unfamiliar with a lot of them i did try to order one once stuff went wrong with the shipping though and i never got my order in the end generally speaking im not that big into makeup and i havent been following stuff like that for years so im not sure which are reputable like i said most of the time i basically frequent boots and superdrug since those are the most accessible to me and thats about it\n\nso does anyone have any reccs thank you so much","lately ive been avoiding waterproof

what i cant get beyond is finding a new makeup look that works for me as i age \n\na little background im almost 32 and have worn a pretty heavy black winged eyeliner look everyday since since i was a teen now that the skin around my eyes is starting become fragile i mean like so very fragile  and is starting to show signs of wrinkles aka crows feetthis old look is obviously becoming hard to achieve a little more context my eyes are a nice blue color but i was not blessed with bug eyes instead they are on the smaller side when i have liner on i feel like not only do they pop and feel a little bigger but they also dont drag emphasis to their sad little lash counterparts which is why i dont do just mascara\n\nthis all leaves me feeling a little lost since i basically decided to master one technique and never learn anything else \n\nwould love any and all suggestions on alternatives or thoughts even on how you have dealt with the perils of aging and how your makeup routine changes

several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that

makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance","ive never

probably land somewhere in neutral territory however how do i know my own personal preferences arent influencing how i determine my undertone  \n\n\nfor example i prefer cooler tones generally

before im pretty sure im neutraltoned description of my features below so i guess this probably doesnt matter too muchbut it really does matter to me and id like to know id like to have at least a decent idea of what looks best on meeven if that does mean warmer colors and gold jewelry id just like to know for sure also im thinking about getting my hair colored so knowing if i should sway more warm or cool matters to me\n\nampx200b\n\njust for some context here are a description of my features that are mostoften used to determine undertone\n\n green eyes\n darkish brown hair\n i think the veins in my arms look mostly green but i feel like there is definitely some blue in there and the veins in my legs tend to be more bluish but im not sure if that matters\n i burn and then tan\n i have freckles and they come out more in the sun but isnt that true for everyone\n here is where i feel like i dont have a clue i feel like my skin is pinkish but then there have definitely been times where to my dismay ive felt like my skin is yellowy is that just my own insecurity my own personal bias again i have no idea but i definitely do think its pinkish in areas particularly in my hands again if that matters im not sure if i blush easily other people would have to tell me that but my face does get red from like exercise and stuff im sorry this is probably of no help\n\nanyone have any idea any advice thanks in advance","i just bought this for 24 usa and i really like it the packaging is very cute and convenient it came with a mirror but it is very dull and i cant really see in it i

greyboth deep and lighter ones suit me\n4 greens in general suit me emeralds parrot green and darker lemon greens are great \n5 blue jewel toned blues suit me but baby blues do not cornflower blue looks best on me along with aquamarine darker blues too\n6 black beige and tan they really look good\n7 darker eyeshadows tend to overwhelm my eyes despite having brown eyes blue eyeshadows dont look good on me my go to choices are always warm neutrals\n8 yellow dusty dirty mustard yellow suits me yellow with a hint of greet suits me\n9 pinkagain nothing too bluish warm deeper pinks are great \n10 purples lilacs lilacs dont suit me but warmer purplesviolets are great \n\n\ni have pigmented lips bordering on brownpurple which makes any peachy lipstick look really fucked up i tend to stick to red

was 3 each for different areas that flareup on my body so i have only 1 for the face so no worries by my dermatologist im also going to use a cleanser and sunscreen the only skincare product i used before was mostly moisturizer i have dry sensitive skin \n\nso do you think makeup will be detrimental or can it work if im putting all of these products on my face","i am looking for a selfsetting foundation because i do not like using powders or setting sprays since they always seem to clog my pores and irritate me\n\n\nso far these are the selfsetting foundations that i have found and the reasons why i would like to switch them for a different one\n\n lorals infallible matte foundation  too drying for my skin and creases a lot even with a moisturizer or primer underneath\n\n loral fresh wear foundation  this one has a poor coverage\n\n catrice hd foundation  breaks me out\n\n\ndoes anyone have other suggestions","anytime i put any type of concealer or foundation on my face it always is immediately extremely flaky and just horrible looking it doesnt matter what primer i use or moisturizer or if i exfoliate or do literally anything before i do my makeup it always happens i just want to wear makeup and i want to give up because ive tried everything this is all brand new makeup and its all different types its even happening with my new tinted moisturizer","ive experimented with makeup a lot before ive just never been consistent about it but recently i got back into practicing again eyeliner and eyebrows for now since i never leave the house and no one can see how bad it might turn out for close to 2 months ive noticed that a few hours after ive shaped my brows filled them in defined them with concealer and blended it out the concealer doesnt stay i have combination skin and my tzone is oily so it almost makes it look like i never put on concealer at allis this because i only put on my regular daily moisturizer and not primer before i do my eyebrows does it matter whether or not i put on primer for just doing my eyebrows i also use a fluffy makeup brush to blend the concealer out not a beauty blenderis that wrong i use nars concealer btw","hello everyone ive been thinking and was curious if anyone feels the same i tried nars tinted moisturizer and like all the other tinted moisturizer ive tried it covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","no foundation or concelor ive tried has worked on me\n\nthe foundation usually ends up looking dry flaky and crusty my acne gets worse even if a moisturise before hand pat it on my skin dry patches

difference","ive tried setting it lightly with a brush but a few hours later it looks so bad but im afraid if i dont do anything the concealer wont stay \ni use the kosas concealer and before that i

very thin in consistency and i could also mix it with a primer or moisturizer so sad its been discontinued and i cant find it anywhere ive seen the cover fx or iconic london but the colors seem to be less gold","i used to do the full glam face with fake eyelashes and the full 9 yards but as i get older early 30s now i just dont care as much im now only doing mascara and brow gel sometimes filling

it on us for bug bites and stuff when we were kids so i figured it was safe but my friend read an article where doctors say that this is not a good idea so im very confused i use good makeup brands

interesting issue that i have been running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","ive had kp on my forehead for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug

meaning that i didnt really think it did much i did cureology but it didnt really give me the results i wanted my skin is really dry after being thoroughly dissatisfied with the way my skin looked with foundation i began doing research into skincare i now have a pretty long skin care routine but the main important productsactive ingredients are cleanser hyaluronic acid vitamin c benzoyl peroxide eye cream and moisturizer collagen and spf after applying these day and night i have noticed a massive change in my makeup today i went to the mall for the first time since incorporating the skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to realize that my makeup didnt look good due to a lack of skincare and if more influencers truly explained why its vital to makeup i think a lot more people would be satisfied with their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with your foundation i beg of you to try and develop a skincare routine all of the products i use are from target and i can go in depth in the comments what do u guys think","hey guys so my eyelashes are

enthused about but i also wear multiple skincare layers under makeupso is it okay to use\n\nsoyesterday i saw a snapchat ad for il makiage foundation promising a perfect shade match and most

i paid shipping before reading any online reviews or looking up ingredients so i did that after and i was alarmed after looking the product woke up like this foundation shade 105 up on cosdna because i saw that it contains myristyl lactate a 4 on the comedogenic scale and alcohol presumably due to fragrance 5 on irritation so i emailed customer service and asked to cancel explaining the situation that i wasnt comfortable with ingredients they were extremely nice and canceled and refunded shipping cost and said i could keep the product if it arrives\n\nlo and beholdit came today literally one day shipping which is insane in and of itself and i was like well its herei guess it wouldnt hurt to try it and it was literally a perfect match\n\nso i dont know what to do because now i have the perfect foundation match for free but its got some less than stellar ingredients the thing is im big on skincare so my premakeup prep is a couple serums moisturizer face oil sunscreen primer im

always find something and stop using it within a few weeks because it isnt giving me that natural look i like personally for me im not sure what looks better option one would be to just use concealer where i need it but i do find it very hard to find a good shade match and by the end of the day i dont find it looks that natural anymore as it dries out and fades option two would be a foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never seem to get the coverage i want from a tinted moisturiser im using a retinol sunscreen and great serums so skincare doesnt seem to be an issue any advice on what would be best for a natural look for a guy would be great","i know the

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

to post my experience w cliniques new even better clinical serum foundation compared to my hg of the last several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation

dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in advance"],["negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","neutral","neutral","neutral","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive"]]},"header":{"fill":{"color":"paleturquoise"},"values":["Cleaned

of concealer or foundation on my face it always is immediately extremely flaky and just horrible looking it doesnt matter what primer i use or moisturizer or if i exfoliate or do literally anything before i do my makeup it always happens i just want to wear makeup and i want to give up because ive tried everything this is all brand new makeup and its all different types its even happening with my new tinted moisturizer","ive experimented with makeup a lot before ive just never been consistent about it but recently i got back into practicing again eyeliner and eyebrows for now since i never leave the house and no one can see how bad it might turn out for close to 2 months ive noticed that a few hours after ive shaped my brows filled them in defined them with concealer and blended it out the concealer doesnt stay i have combination skin and my tzone is oily so it almost makes it look like i never put on concealer at allis this because i only put on my regular daily moisturizer and not primer before i do my eyebrows does it matter whether or not i put on primer for just doing my eyebrows i also use a fluffy makeup brush to blend the concealer out not a beauty blenderis that wrong i use nars concealer btw","hello everyone ive been thinking and was curious if anyone feels the same i tried nars tinted moisturizer and like all the other tinted moisturizer ive tried it covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","no foundation or concelor ive tried has worked on me\n\nthe foundation usually ends up looking dry flaky and crusty my acne gets worse even if a moisturise before hand pat it on my skin dry

lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","ive had kp on my forehead for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug

skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to realize that my makeup didnt look good due to a lack of skincare and if more influencers truly explained why its vital to makeup i think a lot more people would be satisfied with their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with

known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

to post my experience w cliniques new even better clinical serum foundation compared to my hg of the last several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation

lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in

shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry

skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it

their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with your foundation i beg of you to try and develop a skincare routine all of the products i use are from target and i can go in depth in the comments what do u guys think","hey guys so my eyelashes are

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

wash with desert essence thoroughly clean tea tree wash using a konjac sponge to exfoliate a few times a week spritz toner  thayer alcohol free then moisturize with analou 1000 roses night cream this routine leaves me with what i consider to be really good skin for my age 33 and considering that i suffered from compulsive skin picking for most of my life it has really been a great routine for keeping away the triggering blemishes that once destroyed my face and confidence \n\nmakeup routine\n\nim currently using ilia tinted serum and airspun powder on my face im sure airspun is horrible but not sure what else to get instead yet in the mornings when i wear it i wash tone and then when the toner soaks in 2mins or so usually i put a couple drops of ilia on my fingers and rub it in like a moisturizer its a bit tackler so a littler harder to apply but it works really well at giving me a sheer light coverage that im looking for i fan my face for a bit to let the tint dryoxidize if im using a creme blush i apply that next \n\nthe thing is if i use just the ilia alone it is too dewy and just looks really shiny and not likehealthy dewy lol\n\nthen i do a very light dusting or airspun powder with a brush like  very lightswirl the brush in the lid and tap it all off just enough to kill the intense shine of the tint and give me a base for powdered highlightercontourwhatever else im putting on i dont apply ilia or powder to my eyelids bc they are super oily and hooded i use elf eyelid primer would love to switch to something a little better \n\nafter a few hours i get this photos the oil starts coming through and likedisplacing the powder i guess thats what id call it and it starts to settle into creases and looks splotchy esp around chin and my nose and t zone i use blotting paper and that helps with the shine but not really much else \n\nwhen i used to wear heavier foundation nyx hd i think i would use their clear primer beforehand but with ilia since its a skincare productacting as my moisturizer in the am i wasnt sure that i should still use any primer and if i did would i apply it over or under the ilia \n\nso im looking for a way to not look greasy with ilia alone but not look like these photos after a few hours with powder \n\ni dont have a lot to spend on makeup right now that 50 ilia is the most ive ever spent on it but hoping to be pointed in the right direction \n\nthanks for reading and helping \n\ntldr ilia tinted serum alonetoo greasy adding a light dusting of airspun powder  those photos after a few hours help","hi new here  just wanted to post my experience w cliniques new even better clinical serum foundation compared to my hg of the last several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation because its sooo matte any suggestions on a good shaderange dupe that isnt very drying","i currently use the laura mercier tinted moisturizer natural skin perfector in shade 0n1 petal and find its almost perfect  shade matches perfect blends wonderfully and has that like my skin just better look but its awful if it rains  runs all over the show last time it rained it started running straight into my eyes and was actually quite painful does anyone else have this issue \nits heading into winter now so i was hoping to get some recommendations","i was looking out for a sunscreen to go under my makeup a few months ago i searched the internet watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then the weather started getting hotter i applied a substantial amount under my foundation and concealer etc and was shocked  my makeup applied beautifully and my skin looked so healthy because it had this moisturising effect i got minimal creasing under my eyes and on my eyelid but it was basically no different than usual \n\ni wore my makeup for the whole day and got back to assess the damage and my skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was completely fine\n\nid highly recommend this to anyone looking for an undermakeup sunscreen im from the uk and its only 699 for a big tube\n\nheres a link for boots

you can be in the absence of albinism i am tired of my foundation nars natural radiant longwear ending up on my deeper toned partners face and its happened to multiple so cant be boiled down to an individuals specific skin type i have tried urban decay original all nighter setting spray morphe continuous setting mist and the too faced 3 in 1 im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable \n\nanyways its embarrassing and i dont want to have to think about that when im smoochin someone\n\nif it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one lol\n1 skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w spf that i let soak in a little bit\n2

foundation grip what a long name both are great\n5 then top with concealer if applicable andor foundation \n6 totally forgot to add i do spray the setting spray all over once im done with my makeup\n\nthis has always been an issue before my tiktok routine before product changes etc so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better settingfinishing spray or something but im open to anything im genuinely tired of this happening","hi so i have combination skin my skin is mostly dry on my cheeks so when i put on foundation it looks really cakey and dry so recently ive been trying

never tried either of these brands i had my eye on the ilia super serum skin tint for awhile and just now discovered the bare minerals which is intriguing me due to the yellow shades","hi everyone

missing","i think im going to ramble a bit just to help understand my situation better first things first i use makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in

before was mostly moisturizer i have dry sensitive skin \n\nso do you think makeup will be detrimental or can it work if im putting all of these products on my face","i am looking for a selfsetting foundation because i do not like using powders or setting sprays since they always seem to clog my pores and irritate me\n\n\nso far these are the selfsetting foundations that i have found and the reasons why i would like to switch them for a different one\n\n lorals infallible matte foundation  too drying for my skin and creases a lot even with a moisturizer or primer underneath\n\n loral fresh wear foundation  this one has a poor coverage\n\n catrice hd foundation  breaks me out\n\n\ndoes anyone have other suggestions","anytime i put any type of concealer or foundation on my face it always is immediately extremely flaky and just horrible looking it doesnt matter what primer i use or moisturizer or if i exfoliate or do literally anything before i do my makeup it always happens i just want to wear makeup and i want to give up because ive tried everything this is all brand new makeup and its all different types its even happening with my new tinted moisturizer","ive experimented with makeup a lot before ive just never been consistent about it but recently i got back into practicing again eyeliner and eyebrows for now since i never leave the house and no one can see how bad it might turn out for close to 2 months ive noticed that a few hours after ive shaped my brows filled them in defined them with concealer and blended it out the concealer doesnt stay i have combination skin and my tzone is oily so it almost makes it look like i never put on concealer at allis this because i only put on my regular daily moisturizer and not primer before i do my eyebrows does it matter whether or not i put on primer for just doing my eyebrows i also use a fluffy makeup brush to blend the concealer out not a beauty blenderis that wrong i use nars concealer btw","hello everyone ive been thinking and was curious if anyone feels the same i tried nars tinted moisturizer and like all the other tinted moisturizer ive tried it covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","no foundation or concelor ive tried has worked on me\n\nthe foundation usually ends up looking dry flaky and crusty my acne gets worse even if a moisturise before hand pat it on my skin dry patches

difference","ive tried setting it lightly with a brush but a few hours later it looks so bad but im afraid if i dont do anything the concealer wont stay \ni use the kosas concealer and before that i use the la girl color corrector use the la roche posay hyaluronic acid then vanicream daily moisturizer beforehand and then sunscreen before i apply anything i am 29 and have some wrinkles forming now

used  ive looked on mercari and poshmark and even ebay no luck \n\ndoes anyone have a good dupe for this product i have really dry skin and this seemed to work well for me because it was liquid and very thin in consistency and i could also mix it with a primer or moisturizer so sad its been discontinued and i cant find it anywhere ive seen the cover fx or iconic london but the colors seem to be less gold","i used to do the full glam face with fake eyelashes and the full 9 yards but as i get older early 30s now i just dont care as much im now only doing mascara and brow gel sometimes filling in my brows and sometimes not id like to add a tinted moisturizer occasionally and i have no idea where to start\n\nive tried a couple cc and bb creams but i feel like those are usually too thick ive also tried mixing my foundation with my face lotion and its ok but its never consistent and i feel like its streaky sometimes i want something very lightweight and natural to just even out my skin

a few on amazon but i am unsure about those buying options does anyone know if theyre releasing a new version of this product its in a tall bottle with a pump not the container one with a purple label it has a navy blue label with pm in green \n\nneed a night moisturizer for springsummer","i came across a tiktok hack for using calamine lotion as a makeup primer i remember that my mum used to apply it on us for bug bites and stuff when we were kids so i figured it was safe but my friend read an article where doctors say that this is not a good idea so im very confused i use good makeup brands but sometimes i get a mild reaction when i use it for the entire day so i was hoping that calamine would stop that from happening does anyone have any advice","im fairly new to makeup and have found that i prefer eyeliner over everything else i have makeup wipes to clean it off at the end of the day but they seem to be drying out the skin around my eyes and it doesnt help when i use lotion after cleaning my face also i have very think eyelashes and the wipes dont always get it all out what are some affordable eye makeup removers that i can use thatll help get the eyeliner off better without

interesting issue that i have been running into lately due to my particular eye shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","ive had kp on my forehead for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug

meaning that i didnt really think it did much i did cureology but it didnt really give me the results i wanted my skin is really dry after being thoroughly dissatisfied with the way my skin looked with foundation i began doing research into skincare i now have a pretty long skin care routine but the main important productsactive ingredients are cleanser hyaluronic acid vitamin c benzoyl peroxide eye cream and moisturizer collagen and spf after applying these day and night i have noticed a massive change in my makeup today i went to the mall for the first time since incorporating the skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to realize that my makeup didnt look good due to a lack of skincare and if more influencers truly explained why its vital to makeup i think a lot more people would be satisfied with their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with your foundation i beg of you to try and develop a skincare routine all of the products i use are from target and i can go in depth in the comments what do u guys think","hey guys so my eyelashes are

foundationtinted moisturiser however when i have worn foundation in the past i always feel kinda self conscious and worried about it looking heavy and i never seem to get the coverage i want from a tinted moisturiser im using a retinol sunscreen and great serums so skincare doesnt seem to be an issue any advice on what would be best for a natural look for a guy would be great","i know the standard is to use a brush or a foam applicator but i just prefer to use my hands and fingers for this reason i have typically stuck to tinted moisturizers or bb creams i currently use rare beauty tinted moisturizer but i want more coverage any recos","okay im well aware this could be a really dumb question and no i am not talking about primers or moisturizers i swear i once saw a liquid that hardened into a firm gel that can be applied under makeup that acted as a physical barrier between skin and makeup maybe the product i remember was a fever dream but does anything like this exist

going to break the bank but will help me get my skin in order \n\nas for my base makeup i have tried the ilia and beauty blender skin tint i did not love either of them i tried the kosas powder and concealer and did not really understand the hype the powder looked cakey on me and the concealer did not conceal a thing i have been using the nars radiant concealer and its fine but nothing mind blowing i like the color pop hyaluronic tinted moisturizer but it can be drying at the end of the day and not long wearing powder tends to look cakey on me but i cant not wear it because my skin gets oily throughout the day\n\ni would love your recommendations for skin care also a base routine powder foundation tinted moisturizer skin tint concealer bronzer and blush that will be long wearing and

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

to post my experience w cliniques new even better clinical serum foundation compared to my hg of the last several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation

almost perfect  shade matches perfect blends wonderfully and has that like my skin just better look but its awful if it rains  runs all over the show last time it rained it started running straight

my makeup a few months ago i searched the internet watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then the weather started getting hotter i applied a substantial amount under my foundation and concealer etc and was shocked  my makeup applied beautifully and my skin looked so healthy because it had this moisturising effect i got minimal creasing under my eyes and on my eyelid but it was basically no different than usual \n\ni wore my makeup for the whole day and got back to assess the damage and my skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was completely fine\n\nid highly recommend this to anyone looking for an undermakeup sunscreen im from the uk and its only 699 for a big tube\n\nheres a link for boots

lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in

my face","i am looking for a selfsetting foundation because i do not like using powders or setting sprays since they always seem to clog my pores and irritate me\n\n\nso far these are the selfsetting

of concealer or foundation on my face it always is immediately extremely flaky and just horrible looking it doesnt matter what primer i use or moisturizer or if i exfoliate or do literally anything before i do my makeup it always happens i just want to wear makeup and i want to give up because ive tried everything this is all brand new makeup and its all different types its even happening with my new tinted moisturizer","ive experimented with makeup a lot before ive just never been consistent about it but recently i got back into practicing again eyeliner and eyebrows for now since i never leave the house and no one can see how bad it might turn out for close to 2 months ive noticed that a few hours after ive shaped my brows filled them in defined them with concealer and blended it out the concealer doesnt stay i have combination skin and my tzone is oily so it almost makes it look like i never put on concealer at allis this because i only put on my regular daily moisturizer and not primer before i do my eyebrows does it matter whether or not i put on primer for just doing my eyebrows i also use a fluffy makeup brush to blend the concealer out not a beauty blenderis that wrong i use nars concealer btw","hello everyone ive been thinking and was curious if anyone feels the same i tried nars tinted moisturizer and like all the other tinted moisturizer ive tried it covers too much i hate the feeling and look of foundation on my skin so im always looking for something really sheer just to tone down my redness a tiny bit but even the tinted moisturizers thatre said to have the least coverage are too much if thats what i wanted id use a lighter coverage foundation so why cant they just make tinted moistruizers with less coverage i feel like making it so covering kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer so i cant find any that i like and unfortunately the only thing that works is putting only 1 drop of foundation in my face cream does anybody feel the same","no foundation or concelor ive tried has worked on me\n\nthe foundation usually ends up looking dry flaky and crusty my acne gets worse even if a moisturise before hand pat it on my skin dry

that my mum used to apply it on us for bug bites and stuff when we were kids so i figured it was safe but my friend read an article where doctors say that this is not a good idea so im very confused i use good makeup brands but sometimes i get a mild reaction when i use it for the entire day so i was hoping that calamine would stop that from happening does anyone have any advice","im fairly new to

lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry about having a different face the next day any help would be appreciated since i do not have much experience with eyeshadows that arent powder\n\ni didnt have a pic of the dry eyelid issue unfortunately since i usually just try to hydrate it for the day with moisturizer and oil until it goes back to normal but heres what my eye shape looks like so you know what im talking about\n\nhttpspreviewreddityk5yhjdhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps1e07ba7af076f9b18109cda014733070b3851085\n\nhttpspreviewredditbemkfidhy1z91jpgwidth2732ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsd0ac98ac07b6a71fb03105939ce679c2c291519f","ive had kp on my forehead for nearly a year now and its driving me nuts i can no longer go outside without make up and it bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug

skincare and i got so many compliments on my makeup at morphe one of the employees asked me what my secret was to such good looking skin like foundation and it truly is skin care this was further proved to me today when i tested my new winter shade foundation after taking off all of my makeup before skincare i applied it without primer also and it just felt so dry and looked so textured and gross i scrunched my forehead once and got the horrendous forehead lines i used to be so self conscious of it was supposed to be a luminous finish but my skin was soaking up any moisture it could it took me so long to realize that my makeup didnt look good due to a lack of skincare and if more influencers truly explained why its vital to makeup i think a lot more people would be satisfied with their makeup skincare is extremely important before makeup especially if you have dry skin like me if theres anyone out there that thinks skincare makes a minimal differenceif you are unsatisfied with your foundation i beg of you to try and develop a skincare routine all of the products i use are from target and i can go in depth in the comments what do u guys think","hey guys so my eyelashes are

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation

my makeup a few months ago i searched the internet watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then

skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was

lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in

shape i have deep set slightly hooded eyelids with a bit of visible mobile lid exposed when my eyes are fully open however due to genetic bone structure my left eye area is slightly higher than my right side which has led to my eyelid area having an extra wrinkle where it usually folds that basically stacks on top of itself and doubles the visible eyelid space only on that eye specifically when my eyelid gets dry it really throws my facial symmetry off and bothers me quite a bit this usually only happens after using powder eyeshadow especially if i use an eyeshadow primer then powder on top but when i had a laura mercier eyeshadow stick or some drugstore cream eyeshadow pot i didnt have this same issue of my eyelids getting dried out\n\nso i was just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with eyelid dryness when using powder products compared to cream or liquid ones i was wondering if the cream works better because it is basically one thin layer with pigment and primer in one or maybe because it doesnt have as much talcmica or something else as a bulking agent that might add too much bulk of drying on the lids especially if you use a primer underneath the powder too\n\nampx200b\n\ni sometimes just try to wear castor oil or a balm as a slight sheen on the lids that i saw in a historic makeup look but sometimes id like to spice things up a bit and not worry

hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids

failing so instead of discontinuing our foundations and concealers quietly we wanted to share a little about their upcoming departureto reinforce our belief that the things that didnt work out are an equally important part of the journey as those that did  \ngt  \ngtas some of you may know we produce our products here from our happy home in toronto the production process for colours is complex and requires heavy input from many of our team the accessible pricing that we felt was sensible to charge for the formulas would only cover our production costs if the volume that we sold was high despite many people loving the formulas we didnt manage to reach enough of you with our colours range and the products have not been profitable since their launch although we really strongly believe in both products their popularity simply was not strong enough to make their production sustainable  \ngt  \ngtpeople were telling us we needed to market them differently to say they had skincare benefitsto create something that wasnt there but the colours formulations are intentionally simplistic minimalistic suspensions of pigments that even out tone with a realskin finishdesigned to be used with your skincare underneath  \ngt  \ngtletting go of colours has been a tough decision to take especially difficult since many of us here use and love the products our hearts said no but our heads said yes and so we will be saying goodbye to our colours concealers from january 30 2023 on theordinarycom foundations will be with us a little longeruntil june of next year if youre looking for coverage with a real skin finish you may want to explore our serum or coverage foundation just dont fall too in love  \ngt  \ngtcolour may return in our more distant future until then we will continue to play in

alone but not look like these photos after a few hours with powder \n\ni dont have a lot to spend on makeup right now that 50 ilia is the most ive ever spent on it but hoping to be pointed in the right direction \n\nthanks for reading and helping \n\ntldr ilia tinted serum alonetoo greasy adding a light dusting of airspun powder  those photos after a few hours help","hi new here  just wanted to post my experience w cliniques new even better clinical serum foundation compared to my hg of the last several years maybellines fitme matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","im super fair and love the shade range of fenty i use their tinted moisturizer and concealer in shade 110 but cant use the foundation because its sooo matte any suggestions on a good shaderange dupe that isnt very drying","i currently use the laura mercier tinted moisturizer natural skin perfector in shade 0n1 petal and find its almost perfect  shade matches perfect blends wonderfully and has that like my skin just better look but its awful if it rains  runs all over the show last time it rained it started running straight into my eyes and was actually quite painful does anyone else have this issue \nits heading into winter now so i was hoping to get some recommendations","i was looking out for a sunscreen to go under my makeup a few months ago i searched the internet watched videos and eventually stumbled upon the product i mentioned in the title\n\ni bought it but didnt end up using it for a few months  and then the weather started getting hotter i applied a substantial amount under my foundation and concealer etc and was shocked  my makeup applied beautifully and my skin looked so healthy because it had this moisturising effect i got minimal creasing under my eyes and on my eyelid but it was basically no different than usual \n\ni wore my makeup for the whole day and got back to assess the damage and my skin still looked really healthy and nice i was sat in the sun with my friend recently wearing this sunscreen my friend had makeup on but no sunscreen and her cheeks were really burnt but my skin was completely fine\n\nid highly recommend this to anyone looking for an undermakeup sunscreen im from the uk and its only 699 for a big tube\n\nheres a link for boots

you can be in the absence of albinism i am tired of my foundation nars natural radiant longwear ending up on my deeper toned partners face and its happened to multiple so cant be boiled down to an individuals specific skin type i have tried urban decay original all nighter setting spray morphe continuous setting mist and the too faced 3 in 1 im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable \n\nanyways its embarrassing and i dont want to have to

missing","i think im going to ramble a bit just to help understand my situation better first things first i use makeup to cover my dark circles and slightly improve some of my feature such as my lashes so my routine consist of  skin prepping cerave dry skin cleanser the ordinary ha serumnow its nothing in the morning since i just have the niacinamide one that i use a night cerave dry to very dry hydrating lotion  concealer make up forever powder and finally some mascara\n\n it all was well until about a month ago where suddenly as i was about to go after finishing my make up obv i notice that the concealer dried horribly turned into a darkish orangey shade and was burning my under eye skin lol at first i thought it was a one time thing cus it happened once before and managed to help it by removing the makeupputting more cream but i was like hey no time left just remove all of the makeup some skincare and go few days went on and i found out that it was bcs i had dry skin so i was like okay im going to buy a concealer that is covering and suited for dry skin a few sephora trips later and i narrowed down my choice to dior forever concealer i saw many good reviews about it and the few times i got it tested on me it didnt look bad or anything however i did noticed that it didnt stay long on my skin for some reasons brushed it off thinking thats because i didnt set it with powder sooo what happens is that i end up buying it and i wanted to try it out boom it looks great right after the application then a few minutes later most of it disappears off my undereyes i dont know how i could describe this but its really like my skin took any of the concealer i would put as something to be absorbed okayyy fine so why not try to prep my skin and specifically my undereye a little more i redo my skincare and add more cerave hydrating lotion same thing so why not try it another time and try to set it with powder the worst omg it stayed yes but it turned really ugly as in oxidized darkish fineliney ugly honestly based off my experience it feels like the dior concealer isnt covering and just very lightreflecting the tarte was covering and drying but well the coverage didnt change based on how much light there is \n\ni think the issue was due to my skin being dry normally but with the skin prep it was fine until winter came in my opinion and that it needed more care but since it went off radar to my brain i didnt consider that recently idk where i found that info but apparently the cerave hydrating lotion isnt completely moisturizingstrong enough so now i complete it with a la roche posay moisturizer and it doesnt feel nor looks as dry as before \n\nnow my issue is that ive spent for me too much money on simply concealers but im still looking for a concealer that is suited for my skin honestly from what ive heard from my friend whos really keen about makeup and helped me in choosing cosmetic products two good really good concealers for high coverage would be the tarte or the born this way however i cant find my shade in the btw and in tarte its between 27s and 34s depending on the season by the way any issue concerning the tools are brushed off i bought a new beauty blender tried with it and even with a concealer brush \n\ni think this issue could be due to  \n\n my powder which ive noticed makes everything turn orange no matter what even tho its not old and can last for 12 months its the makeupforever translucid powder maybee it made my skin drier \n\n my skin being  dry even if doesnt look  like so \n\nsooo im thinking right now of either going back to tarte but this time trying it with a primer for dry skin or at least dry undereyes or trying the too faced one still with a primer but honestly no shades seem to suit me as im between a pale olive skin and a medium one they all seem to have pink or really gold undertones when yellow ones are suited for my skin type idk if this info could help but i have none of these problems in autumn spring and summer\n\nhahaha this is a long post i hope anyone could help thanks in

of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on

matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","can someone recommend what should i do im using cetaphil moisturiser amp im loving it

toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for

found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15

matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","can someone recommend what should i do im using cetaphil moisturiser amp im loving it

the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my

his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as performance  great coverage unlike most clinique foundations a lovely satinmatte finish doesnt separate or turn shiny lasts all day seems to plump the skin slightly and minimize fine dryness lines wears really well and my skin seems to even look better when i remove it  doesnt clog or break me out  it doesnt dry my skin out as much as maybellines fitme is starting to do  so did not comment despite the mustard color but that could be just him being older and wiser lol   \n\nim getting old and the older i get the harder it is to find a foundation that does not slide off my oily skin but also doesnt make it look dry  very narrow tightrope to walk  fitme matteporeless has been amazing but as i get older i need something just a little more forgiving on ageing texture and fine lines  i really love the performance of this new clinique even better clinical serum fndtn but the color selection is not good for me  even though they have 42 shades they are all either really pink or really yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are the same as the clinical serum version  i got the one for the very fair and the fair to light shades and the colors are all either pink toned or yellow toned  the closest matches i can find are wn04 bone  a shade too pale  wn 16 buff a shade too yellow  and cn 28 ivory quite a bit too pink  gah  i know some people mix shades but i aint got time for that  \n\nok long story short  anybody else try this new foundation and did you have a hard time finding the right shade  how did you like the performance  tia","can someone recommend what should i do im using cetaphil moisturiser amp im loving it

beautifully and which lengthen the brows without looking wonky and unnatural ive thought about micro blading but i dont want dark bold brows because my hair isnt dark plus the fact i cant wash the area after having it done will bug me also im looking for good eyebrow pencils which are available in the uk many thanks","ive never been really experienced with makeup but i saw people try on the fenty skin tint and everyone ive seen try it love it so i got it i use the benefit porefessional primer the regular one usually as a base for highlighter and other stuff since it says it can be used for that too except i have a small sample of the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying moisturizer cetaphil facewash for combination skin and occasionally a toner and some vitamin c serum im not acneprone and my skin is relatively clear with a few cystic pimples every now and then so i figured what i was using for my skincare was fine but now im not sure and dont know what primer to use google is not helpful either so to my gurus i request assistance","im not even kidding if i press a tissue to my face after less than an hour some of the product will have transferred im fairly new to wearing makeup its only been a few months so i dont exactly know what im doing all advice and tips are appreciated\n\ni

as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","what are you favorite clinique products  i need some suggestionsdoes the eyeliner stay on the waterline  how is their foundation and bronzer and blush i would like to start using their products but dont know which are the best  thank you for your help","hi people so i recently brought a new foundation the ordinary one and this is the 4th one ive tried and guess what ive been allergic to all 4 \n\nso i thought id be smart and lather up my face with primer so the foundation didnt come directly onto my skin it obviously didnt work \n\nin this pandemic i cant risk spending 30 on a hypoallergenic foundation as all the shops are shut and it would be sensible to get a sample at least \n\ndoes anyone recommend or know what would happen if i used concealer as a foundation has anyone had any experience doing this\n\nfor anyone wondering the foundations ive previously used no 7 clinique true match the ordinary \n\nsummary can you use

natural curl the ends of my lashes curl into a slight loop behind the rest of my lashes i typically have a few lashes growing in odd directions as well \n\nive heard of people using eyelash curlers in reverse to straighten out their lashes but this feel like too much effort for my everyday look to be honest \n\ni am pretty satisfied with the volume of my lashes im looking for a mascara that will lengthen my lashes without clumping them i cant apply more than 1 to 15 coats without clumping i also tend to prefer mascaras made for sensitive eyes but its not a dealbreak if not \n\ni like the loreal telescopic mascara under the clinique lash primer but find that it results in a somewhat spider lash effect even after combing through with a lash combseparator \n\ni would love to hear any recommendations for mascara andor application tips","when i leave for work at 730 my makeup looks flawless and smooth but by 11 its starting to separate cling to certain spots and crease heavily

with makeup but i saw people try on the fenty skin tint and everyone ive seen try it love it so i got it i use the benefit porefessional primer the regular one usually as a base for highlighter and other stuff since it says it can be used for that too except i have a small sample of the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying

bums me out big time as it makes me feel so high maintenance ive found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","what are you favorite clinique products  i need some suggestionsdoes the eyeliner stay on the waterline  how is their

matteporeless and ask about anyone elses experience w this new foundation  the fitme has been my hg for a long time  inexpensive nicely matte easy to use goofproof can slap on and go doesnt break me out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as

yellow  nothing slightly pink or slightly yellow or neutral  \n\ni obtained 2 sample cards for the regular even better as the clinique advisor said most of the colors for the regular even better are

love it so i got it i use the benefit porefessional primer the regular one usually as a base for highlighter and other stuff since it says it can be used for that too except i have a small sample of the same stuff but the hydrating version that i use on my tzone the rest of my forehead and the rest of my nose i do that because those parts look dried out if i use the regular one but the rest of my face is fine ive never known my skin type and have no idea how to tell sounds dumb i know so i dont know if what im using is right i only say this because when i tried the fenty skin tint despite the hydrating primer fixing the flaky dry stuff that shows when i use the regular primer the skin tint makes it dry and flaky not only on my nose but my forehead and temples also look flaky the places i put the regular primer were fine but im confused as to why when i do hydrating primer and no skin tint its fine but the second i do hydrating primer and skin tint it looks flaky without primer my forehead nose and eyelids get very oily throughout the day the rest of my face is fine i use philosophy mattifying moisturizer cetaphil facewash for combination skin and occasionally a toner and some

found myself feeling so jealous every time i ever see anyone with clear nonred skin\n\nluckily i have found some products that have toned it down for most of this year i was using eucerin urea repair in the morning neostrata lotion plus at night and then using cetaphil and cerave cleansers it has helped a lot and i am grateful for that but i cant help getting upset still at how my skin looks \n\ni recently noticed that using the neostrata cream both morning and night without using the eucerin helps tame it down a bit more i found that it helped my make up look better as well but now its gone back to looking bad again\n\nwhen i apply my makeup on my forehead it looks really dry i think this is because the neostrata has 15 glycolic acid the eucerin is a lot more moisturising but my kp looks better with the neostrata so i dont know what to do \n\nive also noticed that my skin seems to be more blotchy than usual before kp i used to be able to put only foundation on and maybe a bit of concealer for spots but now i have to put concealer on everywhere as theres red splotches everywhere aka my skin tone is really uneven\n\nthe makeup i use right now is elf foundation superdrug concealer and body shop powder i realised these are relatively cheap brands so maybe this is part of the problem at this point i would spend more money on products if they help me feel better about how i look","what are you favorite clinique products  i need some suggestionsdoes the eyeliner stay on the waterline  how is their foundation and bronzer and blush i would like to start using their

out or turn into an oil slick on my oilybutdehydrated clogprone and sensitive skin and the color matches are perfecto  classic ivory 120 is a perfect exact match  for reference i am dr baummann skintype ospt last time i took that test probably now an ospw\n\nclinique has always interested me w its goodforyou skin ings but the last few times ive tried clinique foundations they didnt work  the even better line was way too shiny and the coverage was way too light  also the colors were all off  either too yellow or too pink  nothing truly neutral or yellowneutral  the one and only time my so ever said anything bad about my mu was when i wore cliniques even better foundation  he said something like   you have something on your face  what is that  squints and looks closer concerned look on his face not good  \n\nwhen the new even better clinical serum foundation came out it looked really good and i wanted to try it  finding the match for maybellines fitme classic ivory 120 was hell tho  temptalias foundation matrix didnt give me a good match  sephoras shade finder didnt work  the online clinique questionnaire was a joke  asking questions about skin veins and which photo do you look most like  egads  why cant we match foundations colors across brands like we do w paint at home depot  i should be able to type in the brand and color and a machine spits out the exact match to another brand based on pigment colors and ratios  anyway i tried asking the clinique live chat and the chat person said wn 38 stone would be an exact match to maybellines classic ivory 120  not  \n\nstone was actually abt 2 shades darker and 2 shades more yellow than the classic ivory  i looked like i had mustard on my face  however this new clinique foundation is amazing as far as
