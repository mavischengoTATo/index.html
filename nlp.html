                      Top Word: <b>'deleted'</b> with a score of 0.8975.<br>
                      Analysis: This might indicate that the first submission was deleted or the text content was removed before analysis. The presence of the word <b>'deleted'</b> suggests that the post might have been redacted or edited after initial posting.<br><br>

This submission seems to be rich in content about eye makeup preferences, techniques, or product recommendations.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>Third Submission:</strong><br>
                      Top Word: <b>'removed'</b> with a score of 1.5530.<br>
                      Analysis: Similar to the first submission, this might indicate a post that was edited or had its content removed. The word <b>'removed'</b> can be associated with posts that have undergone modifications or deletions.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>Overall Insights:</strong> The dominant presence of words related to eye makeup in the second submission suggests that this is a key topic of interest or discussion in the subreddit. The frequent mention of specific brands (<b>'fenty'</b>, <b>'nars'</b>) could indicate brand preferences or discussions about these brands' products. The presence of words like <b>'deleted'</b> and <b>'removed'</b> in other submissions suggests that some posts might be moderated, edited, or removed post-publishing, which is common in online communities for various reasons.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>First Comment:</strong><br>
                      <b>'brother'</b> (7.64): High relevance, possibly discussing a personal experience or story involving a brother. <b>'sheer'</b> (5.75): Could refer to a type of makeup finish, indicating a discussion about product characteristics. <b>'onto'</b> (5.60): A connecting word, its high score might indicate unique usage in the context. <b>'ones'</b> (4.78): Likely referring to specific products or types of makeup. <b>'get'</b> (2.91): General usage, but its context in the comment could be unique.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>Second Comment:</strong><br>
                      <b>'mentioned'</b> (6.05): Indicates reference to something previously discussed, possibly a product or technique. <b>'nose'</b> (4.57): Likely discussing makeup application related to the nose, such as contouring. <b>'concealer'</b> (3.60): Direct reference to a makeup product, possibly discussing its use or properties.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>Third Comment:</strong><br>
                      <b>'lipsticks'</b> (5.63): Direct reference to a category of makeup product. <b>'ones'</b> (4.78): As before, likely refers to specific types of products or brands. <b>'cool'</b> (4.12): Could be describing a color palette or general appeal of a product. <b>'looks'</b> (2.34): Might refer to makeup looks or styles.<br><br>
                  
                      <strong>Interpretation and Insights:</strong> The words with the highest TF-IDF scores are likely key topics or themes within each comment. These words are more unique to the comment in the context of your entire dataset. Words like <b>"brother"</b>, <b>"sheer"</b>, <b>"nose"</b>, <b>"concealer"</b>, and <b>"lipsticks"</b> suggest a focus on personal experiences, product characteristics, and specific makeup items. The context in which these words are used (e.g., discussing a product, sharing a personal story, giving advice) would provide more depth to the analysis. However, this requires examining the full text of the comments. The presence of more general words like <b>"get"</b> and <b>"ones"</b> with high scores may indicate a unique usage pattern in these specific comments, which sets them apart from the rest of the dataset.

                      <p>The project "Evaluating Influencers’ Emotional Impact" expanded to include the dimension of 'posting_karma' to measure the value of influencers' contributions to the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit. Our methodology combined PySpark and Spark NLP for data sourcing and preparation, ensuring that our sentiment analysis was grounded on a dataset enriched with additional metrics like karma scores.</p>
                      <p>Our dataset was augmented with external data from the Python Reddit API Wrapper, adding a new variable 'posting_karma'. This allowed us to assess not only the sentiment of the influencers' interactions but also the community's valuation of their contributions.</p>
                      <li><b>2. Sentiment Analysis Pipeline Enhanced with Karma Consideration</b></li>
                      <p>Our sophisticated sentiment analysis model was enriched with an understanding of the influencers' karma scores. This helped us contextualize the emotional tones of responses within the broader scope of the influencers' reputation and authority as reflected by their karma.</p>
                      <li><b>3. Revised Business Goals with External Data Integration</b></li>
                      <p>Following the exploratory task of identifying the top 10 creators, we move on to assess the sentiment of top creators' comments to gauge the overall emotional tone of their response. This will provide further and more scientific insights into the influencer-audience interactions in MakeupAddiction.</p>                      
                      <li><b>4. Results and Visualization Incorporating Karma Data</b></li>
                      <p>Integrating 'posting_karma' data revealed a correlation between influencers' engagement levels and their recognized value in the community. We visualized this relationship, showing a moderate correlation coefficient of 0.46 between posting karma and creator scores, suggesting that influencers who contribute valuable content also tend to engage positively with their audience.</p>

                          <ul>
                              <li>Our project aimed to uncover the sentiment and community reception of content within the top 30 tags in the MakeupAddiction subreddit.</li>
                              <li>We started by setting up a PySpark session, ensuring the necessary NLP libraries like Spark NLP and NLTK were in place.</li>
                              <li>Data was sourced from the subreddit, focusing on posts tagged within our scope. This dataset was then sampled, reducing its size to a manageable level while retaining statistical significance.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <li>2. Data Preprocessing and Analysis:</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The preprocessing phase involved employing Document Assembler and Normalizer from Spark NLP to standardize and clean the text data.</li>
                            <li>We identified the top 30 tags based on the volume of comments, allowing us to concentrate our analysis on the most engaging topics within the subreddit.</li>
                            <li>A pivot in our initial strategy occurred here: <b>instead of the top 100 tags, we refocused on the top 30, as they represented the core areas of community interest.</b></li>
                            <iframe src="nlp/top_100_tag_table.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
                            <p>As illustrated by the table where the frequency of comments noticeably declines beyond the 30th tag. This concentration indicates that the community's discourse is not spread thinly over numerous subjects but is instead deeply rooted in a select few areas of significant interest. By focusing our NLP and sentiment analysis on these core 30 tags, we ensure that our evaluation is not only more robust due to the rich density of data points within each category but also more representative of the subreddit's active and dynamic discussions. This pivot to a more targeted analysis of the top 30 tags allows us to deliver insights with greater precision, offering a distilled view of the community's pulse and enabling stakeholders to craft strategies that resonate strongly with the most engaging content areas.</p>

                              The graph titled "Top 30 Tags by Number of Comments" visualizes the distribution of comments across various tags in the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit. It's immediately apparent that the community engagement is heavily skewed towards a few specific tags, with "face of the day" and "question" garnering the most attention, indicated by the tallest bars on the graph. These two tags alone have a significantly higher number of comments—over 30,000 and nearly 29,000 respectively—highlighting them as the most popular and engaging topics within the community.<br><br>
                              As we move beyond these tags, there's a steep drop-off in the number of comments, with the third most popular tag, "discussion," having just under 6,000 comments. The graph then shows a gradual decline as we move through the subsequent tags. This pattern indicates that while there is a range of topics that interest the community, a select few topics dominate the conversation. The sharp decrease from the second to the third tag and the relatively flat distribution amongst the remaining tags suggest that while the subreddit has a variety of discussions, user engagement is concentrated in top-tier topics.<br><br>
                              The lower end of the graph, which includes tags such as "self," "saturday," "shitpost," "harassmentbigotry," "ama," and "news," has the least number of comments, all below 100. This suggests that these topics are either more niche or less provocative of discussion among the community members.<br><br>
                              Overall, the graph effectively illustrates the disparity in user engagement across different discussion tags within the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit and could be indicative of the community's preferences or the influence of trending topics at the time of data collection. For stakeholders looking to engage with or market to this community, focusing on the highly engaging tags could provide better visibility and interaction rates.

                       <p>The provided bar chart visualizes the proportion of sentiment categories—Positive, Neutral, and Negative—across various tags. The data suggests a predominant occurrence of Neutral sentiments across most tags, which implies a balanced or moderate tone in discussions related to those topics. Notably, the tags associated with 'tutorial', 'swatches', and 'showcase' exhibit a higher percentage of Positive sentiments, indicating a favorable reception or approval from the community in these areas.<br><br>

                        Conversely, the 'harassmentbigotry' tag shows an overwhelming Negative sentiment, which could be attributed to discussions around negative experiences or issues that are critically viewed by the community. The 'face of the day' and 'haul' tags also display a significant portion of Positive sentiment, suggesting these are well-received topics within the community.<br><br>
                        
                        The presence of Positive sentiment in creative or personal sharing tags like 'tutorial', 'swatches', and 'haul' could reflect a supportive community environment that encourages individual expression. In contrast, the high Negative sentiment in 'harassmentbigotry' could reflect community concerns or discussions around sensitive topics.<br><br>
                        
                        Overall, the chart provides a valuable snapshot of the community's emotional response to different topics, highlighting areas of common interest, support, and contention. This insight could guide content moderation, community engagement strategies, and the development of resources to foster positive interactions and address areas of concern.</p>
                      <iframe src="nlp/top30-senti-prop-body.html" style="transform: scale(0.65); transform-origin: top left;"width="160%" height="800px"></iframe>
                      <p>The bar chart presents the proportion of sentiment categories—Negative, Neutral, and Positive—associated with different tags derived from the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit. At a glance, the predominance of green bars, which signify positive sentiment, suggests that the overall tone of discussions is generally positive across the majority of tags. This indicates an engaging and supportive community atmosphere, especially in discussions around "tutorial," "swatches," and "haul," where the Positive sentiment seems to be notably high.<br><br>

                        Some tags, like "review" and "question," have a significant presence of red bars, indicating a higher proportion of negative sentiments. These could potentially point to critical evaluations or challenging questions within the community discourse. The "psa" (public service announcement) tag shows a relatively balanced distribution across all three sentiment categories, which could signify a mix of informative, advisory, and cautionary tones in these posts.<br><br>
                        
                        The "harassmentbigotry" tag stands out with a high negative sentiment, likely reflecting serious discussions around negative experiences or issues within the community that evoke a strong emotional response.<br><br>
                        
                        The visualization serves as a helpful tool for subreddit moderators and community managers to understand the emotional undertones across different discussion topics, which can inform content moderation policies and community engagement strategies. It also provides an indication of which topics are received well by the community and which may require more attention due to the presence of negative sentiments.</p>
                        <li>5. Findings and Implications:</li>
                        <p>The analysis of sentiment across different tags in the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit yields significant insights. A predominance of Neutral sentiments in many tags suggests that conversations are generally balanced and moderate, avoiding extreme emotional tones. However, certain tags like 'tutorial', 'swatches', and 'showcase' predominantly feature Positive sentiments, indicating these subjects are highly favored and well-received in the community. This positive reception showcases a community that values and supports creative and personal sharing endeavors.<br><br>
                        
                        Conversely, the noticeable Negative sentiment in tags like 'harassmentbigotry' highlights critical or sensitive issues within the community that might be of concern. This could be reflective of discussions around negative experiences or issues that are critically viewed by the community members. The existence of Negative sentiment in tags like 'review' and 'question' could point to critical evaluations or challenging questions, suggesting a space for open and honest discourse, albeit possibly contentious.<br><br>
                        
                        The Positive sentiments observed in 'face of the day', 'haul', and similar tags underline their popularity and engagement levels within the community, indicating these topics are areas of high interest and interaction. However, the high Negative sentiment in 'harassmentbigotry' warrants attention, as it reflects serious community concerns and discussions around sensitive topics.<br><br>
                        
                        Overall, these findings provide crucial insights for subreddit moderators, community managers, and brands looking to engage with this community. They highlight areas of common interest and support, as well as potential zones of contention. This understanding is vital for shaping effective content moderation, community engagement strategies, and marketing approaches. It also points to the necessity for resources to foster positive interactions and address areas of concern within the community.</p>

                        <p>Our primary objective was to explore the evolving language landscape of the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit between 2021 and 2023. We aimed to trace the development of colloquialisms and terminology, offering insights into consumer preferences, cultural shifts, and emerging trends in the beauty and cosmetics community.<br><br>
                          We initiated our journey by setting up a PySpark session to handle the vast dataset efficiently. Data was sourced from the subreddit, ensuring a comprehensive collection of user interactions and discussions. Our preprocessing steps included text normalization, such as lowercasing, removing URLs, numbers, punctuation, and short words. We employed Tokenizer and StopWordsRemover for a clean dataset, ready for deeper analysis.
                        </p>
                        <li>2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):</li>
                        <p>Utilizing TF-IDF, we identified and highlighted significant terms in the dataset. We chose a subset of data to maintain a focus on the most relevant content. Each term's TF-IDF score helped us understand its relative importance in the subreddit's discussions. This step was crucial in pinpointing emerging or declining trends in makeup-related terminology.<br><br>
                          We extended our analysis to a temporal dimension, extracting year and month information from the posts. This allowed us to observe how certain terms gained or lost popularity over time, reflecting the dynamic nature of the makeup community's language.
