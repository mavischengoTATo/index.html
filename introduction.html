										<p>In our endeavor to effectively manage the extensive datasets associated with the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit, which encompasses both submission and comments datasets, we have implemented a series of data preprocessing steps. These measures are designed to enhance the overall quality of our data and ensure that subsequent data analysis tasks are performed efficiently and accurately.</p>
										<p>One of the initial steps in data preprocessing involved the removal of columns with a significant number of missing values. This was done to eliminate noise and enhance the overall data quality, ensuring that our analyses are based on reliable and complete information.</p>
										<p>In terms of data temporality, we narrowed our focus to records spanning the years 2021 to 2023. This temporal selection allows us to work with more recent and relevant data, ensuring that our analyses are reflective of the most current trends and insights within the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit.</p>
										<p>To further streamline data processing and reduce computational complexity, we employed a random sampling technique on both the submission and comments datasets. By randomly selecting a subset of data, we effectively limited our dataset size to no more than 10,000 rows. This strategic downsizing enables more efficient data analysis while maintaining data representativeness.</p>
										<p>These meticulous data preprocessing steps have been carefully undertaken to prepare a refined and manageable dataset for our subsequent data analysis tasks. By eliminating missing values, focusing on recent data, and employing random sampling, we have optimized our data for high-performance analytics, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and efficient.</p>

									<h3><b>Selected and Created Variables (Interesting Variables) For EDA Analysis</b></h3>
									<li><b>Inclusion of Content Categorization Dummy Variables</b></li>
									<p>We included the dummy variables “Skincare,” “Bodycare,” and “Makeup” to categorize and analyze specific content areas within the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit. These variables allow us to differentiate posts related to skincare, body care, and makeup, enabling focused analysis of user preferences, engagement levels, and trends within each of these beauty-related topics. This segmentation enhances our ability to conduct targeted analyses, identify prevalent content categories, and uncover unique patterns, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive EDA of the subreddit.</p>
									<li><b>Introduction of New Variables</b></li>
									<p>The creation of the new variables “is_top_100_creator,” “is_peak_hours,” and “is_long_text” enriches our analysis of the subreddit. “is_top_100_creator” identifies influential users, aiding our study of their impact on the community. “is_peak_hours” helps us determine optimal posting times and provides insights into community activity patterns. “is_long_text” allows us to differentiate lengthy textual content, facilitating in-depth textual analysis. These variables offer a nuanced understanding of user behavior, content dynamics, and community engagement, enhancing the depth and comprehensiveness of our analysis.	</p>

									<li><b>Expansion to Product and Brand Analysis (Dummy Variables)</b></li>
									<p>In addition, we introduced dummy variables such as “skincare_product,” “skincare_product_brand,” “makeup_product,” and “makeup_product_brand.” These variables allow us to explore specific products within the skincare, makeup, and body care categories. Furthermore, they enable us to identify the brands associated with these products. This structured approach enhances the granularity of our analysis, enabling us to uncover patterns and preferences related to specific products and brands within each beauty category, providing a more detailed and insightful perspective on the “MakeupAddiction”</p>
									</section>
									<section id="external" class="main">
									<h3><b>Add External New Variables</b></h3>
									<p>In our data analysis project, we have try to collect integrated external data related to Karma, which is a reflection of how much a Reddit user’s contributions mean to the community. We have introduced a new variable named “posting_karma” to our dataset, and this variable represents the Karma score of the author of each submission. This addition of Karma data enhances our dataset and offers valuable insights into the engagement and influence of Reddit users within the MakeupAddiction subreddit.</p>
									<p>Adding “posting_karma” to our dataset is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows us to assess user engagement and reputation within the Reddit community, providing insights into how their contributions are perceived. Higher Karma scores indicate more credibility and influence, making this variable valuable for brands, influencers, and content creators seeking to collaborate with influential voices. Moreover, it aids in analyzing the relationship between posting Karma and the popularity of submissions, offering actionable insights for content creation and engagement strategies. This addition also enables user profiling, content recommendation, influencer identification, and community insights, ultimately enriching our dataset and providing a comprehensive view of user engagement and influence, serving various strategic and analytical purposes.</p>

								<h2><b>11 Data Science Topics</b></h2>
								<h3>Exploratory</h3>
								<h4><b>Cultivating Optimal Posting Strategies: Unveiling Makeup Trends on ‘MakeupAddiction’ for Influencers and Brands</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Business Goals:</li>
    <p>Determine peak hours and identify seasonality trends and potential festival or holiday impacts for makeup-related content to guide influencers and brands about optimal posting times.</p>
    <li>Technical Proposals:</li>
    <p>For the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit spanning 2021 to 2023, using “submissions” dataset, we’ll analyze daily posting trends. By extracting posting hours from the created_utc column, we can categorize and count posts during each hour and calculate their average scores. A combined line and bar graph by Plotly will then be generated: the line indicating hourly post volume and the bar showcasing average post scores. Using color distinctions—blue for volume and orange for engagement—the visualization will offer a succinct overview. Besides, we’ll extract dates from the created_utc column to analyze yearly posting patterns. Grouping the data by date, we’ll determine both the frequency of posts and their average scores. To effectively visualize these metrics, a dual-axis time-series plot will be employed: the primary y-axis will display post counts using bars, while the secondary y-axis will plot average scores as a line graph. This integrated view allows us to simultaneously gauge post volume and user engagement quality.</p>

    <p>The goal is to augment the reach and influence of content on the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit by predicting post popularity. This will allow creators and brands to more effectively engage with their audience by tailoring content strategies according to predicted engagement levels. To achieve this, we will extract and engineer several features from our dataset: Post Length: We will calculate the length of the post from the <code>body</code> column. Makeup Theme: The <code>author_flair_text</code> will be utilized to determine the makeup theme associated with a post. Posting Hour: Extract the hour from the <code>created_utc</code> to identify peak engagement times. Categorical Features: We will create dummy variables for categorical data representing various themes and topics such as ‘skincare’, ‘makeup’, ‘beauty’, ‘styles’, ‘bodycare’, ‘haircare’, ‘facial’, ‘cosmetics’, ‘sunscreen’, ‘bodypaint’. This will allow the model to differentiate posts based on these categories effectively. Creator Popularity<strong>: The ‘is_top_100_creator’ dummy variable will indicate whether the post was made by one of the top 100 creators in the subreddit. Peak Hours: The ‘is_peak_hours’ variable will flag posts created during times of historically high engagement. Text Length</strong>: The ‘is_long_text’ variable will indicate if a post contains a longer than average text body, which could impact engagement. A Gradient Boosted Regressor and other will be employed as the supervised regression model, trained on these features with the objective of predicting the <code>score</code> of a post, which serves as our popularity metric. We will partition the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model’s generalizability. Performance will be assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) metric, which measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE scores will be indicative of more accurate predictions of post popularity. Upon achieving satisfactory performance, the predictive model will be deployed as a tool for creators and brands, providing them with actionable insights on the potential popularity of their upcoming content on “MakeupAddiction.” This strategy aims to optimize engagement by aligning content creation with data-driven predictions.</p>
